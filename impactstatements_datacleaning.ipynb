Honorable Judge 2516Aquilina, thank you for giving me this opportunity to 1tell you how Larry Nassar has hurt me and the effect 2that this has had on my life. 3I am Jessica Thomashow, also known as 4victim A.  I was sexually assaulted by Larry Nassar 5when I was nine and 12 years old.  Today I am 17 and 6a senior in high school, and this is my story.  7My childhood was filled with happiness and 8love.  One of my loves was for gymnastics and for all 9my teammates in the gym.  Gymnastics was a big part 10of my childhood, and I spent many hours in the gym 11and at competitions, though, as you know, with 12gymnastics it is a very physically demanding sport 13and often comes with painful injuries.  14I remember one of my first injuries, a rib 15misplacement.  This was the first time I heard of 16Larry Nassar and his reputation.  I remember telling 17my mom that my coaches told me I should see Larry 18Nassar for my injury, and to my surprise, she knew 19who he was.  She had trained under him when she went 20to medical school at Michigan State University.  21One night my coaches arranged for me to see 22Nassar after practice to help with my rib injury.  23Monday nights were when Larry Nassar came to Twistars 24to treat injured team gymnasts.  I remember my 2517coaches telling me to go see him, and I was actually 1quite excited.  Then I went into the back room, and 2that's when everything changed.  3I was alone in the back room with him.  He 4had me lie down on the table and he sexually 5assaulted me.  He touched the most innocent places on 6my body that day.  7I remember fear and pain and asking myself, 8what is happening?  When it was over, I was so 9confused.  What had he just done to me, and why?  It 10was awful and embarrassing.  I left and kept the 11disgusting thing that had just happened to me to 12myself.  13Two years passed.  I saw him several times 14again at his clinic at MSU, always with my mom, and 15they were normal appointments.  Then in 2012 it 16happened again, right around my 12th birthday.  I had 17a stress fracture in my ankle and my dad took me to 18that appointment.  Before Nassar assaulted me, we had 19a great, meaningful conversation about my future.  He 20asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, and I 21said, I want to be just like you, a sports medicine 22doctor.  23He gave me a gift, a pin from the Olympics, 24and told me, when you take my place as the new sports 2518\n"

What is it you would like the court 21to know?  22MS. STEPHENS', '  Is that an indication for me 23to start?  24THE COURT', '  Yes.253MS. STEPHENS', \"  Good morning.  My name is 1Kyle Stephens.  Up until this point I have been known 2as victim ZA or family friend.  I was the first to 3testify in this case, and weary of the attention that 4can come with that, I asked for anonymity.  5This process has been horrific, but 6surprisingly therapeutic.  I am addressing you 7publicly today as a final step and statement to 8myself that I have nothing to be ashamed of. 9I met Larry Nassar when I was somewhere 10around the age of five years old.  My parents had 11become close friends with Larry and his wife, 12Stephanie.  They were all medical professionals and 13shared a passion for the subject.  14Most Sundays Stephanie and my mother would 15cook dinner together for both families.  We shared 16sporting events, holidays, and many weekends in 17between.  18It was during this time, I estimate I was 19approximately six years old, that Larry Nassar began 20to sexually abuse me.  He first exposed his penis to 21me in a dark boiler room in the basement of his home.  22He told me, if you ever want to see it, all you have 23to do is ask.  He used his power as an adult to 24manipulate me.  254Over a six year period he progressed from 1exposure to masturbating in front of me while playing 2hide and go seek, rubbing his bare penis on my bare 3feet, and penetrating my vagina with his fingers, all 4of which took place with my parents, my sibling, his 5wife, and his children in the same house.  6Let me remind you of the interests of a six 7year old girl.  My favorite t.v. show was Clifford, 8the big red dog, and my favorite book was Junnie B. 9Jones.  I could not do a multiplication problem and 10still had not lost all my baby teeth.  11I think we can all agree that someone of 12this maturity level should not be sexually active.  13But I was.  Without my knowledge or consent I had 14engaged in my first sexual experience by kindergarten 15and joined an overwhelming statistic of sexual abuse 16victims.  17It took the media coverage of the sexual 18abuse scandal in the Catholic church and a friend 19confiding the details of her sexual abuse for me to 20realize that something was wrong.  I was 12 years old 21when I told my parents, when Larry rubbed my feet, he 22used his penis.  My parents confronted him and he 23denied any such action.  24Due to complex details that I won't get 255into here, my parents chose to believe Larry Nassar 1over me.  2I spent the years between 12 and 18 3avoiding and detaching from my family.  To my father, 4someone who makes such heinous false accusations is 5the worst type of person.  His belief that I had lied 6seeped into the foundation of our relationship.  7Every time we got into a fight he would tell me, you 8need to apologize to Larry.  9I learned to ask for very little as I 10wanted my parents to know that I didn't need them, 11just as I felt they didn't want me.  12It wasn't until I was about to leave for 13college when my father again pulled a need to 14apologize card and then I took another chance of 15clearing my name.  I told him that I wasn't lying and 16that Larry Nassar had indeed sexually abused me.  17Larry Nassar's actions had already caused 18me significant anguish, but I hurt worse as I watched 19my father realize what he had put me through.  20My father and I did our best to patch up 21our tattered relationship before he committed suicide 22in 2016.  Admittedly, my father was experiencing 23debilitating health issues, but had he not had to 24bear the shame and self-loathing that stemmed from 25602/13/2018 09\", '13', \"26 AMPage 7 to 10 of 2174 of 57 sheetshis defense of Larry Nassar, I believe he would have 1had a fighting chance for his life.  2Larry Nassar wedged himself between myself 3and my family and used his leverage as my parents' 4trusted friend to pry us apart until we fractured.  5And fractured we did.  6My relationship with my mother is still 7marbled with pain, anger, and resentment, and for a 8long time I told people that I did not have a family.  9I think it is important to note my 10relationship with the Nassar family after I accused 11him at age 12.  A year or two passed from the time 12that I made the accusation and our families began to 13spend time together again.  I was around 14 years old 14when Stephanie began pressuring me to babysit the 15Nassars' three children.  I responded with dismissive 16answers for a lengthy period of time before 17relenting.  18It was at this point that I began to feel 19brainwashed.  At home I was a liar and when I was at 20the Nassars, either with my family or babysitting, it 21was as if I never accused him.  I felt I was losing 22my grip on reality.  I started to question whether 23the abuse ever really happened.  For my own sanity, I 24forced myself to walk through the abuse step by step 257so I didn't forget that I was not a liar.  It is to 1this that I credit my ability to recall the abuse so 2well throughout this process.  3As I continued to babysit for the Nassars I 4started to become resolved to my purpose there.  With 5two young girls in the home I felt protective and 6that somehow my presence there would make a 7difference.  For seven years and several years into 8counseling -- for seven years and several years into 9counseling I cared for those children with all my 10heart.  My detachment from my family forced me to 11search for grants, participate in post-traumatic 12studies, ask for sliding scales, and babysit for the 13Nassars to pay for my own counseling.  14When I look back now, I realize that my 15spirit was broken, lost, and confused, but then all I 16could think is that I needed to be there for those 17children in whatever way I could.  It was not until I 18was 21 that I cut all ties with the Nassar family.  19The complex feelings of shame, disgust, and 20self hatred brought me bouts of depression, anxiety, 21eating disorders, and other compulsive conditions.  22Sometimes I think it's hard for people to translate 23these generic terms into reality.  For me, it was a 24girl crying on the floor for hours trying not to rip 258out too much of her hair.  For me, it was a girl 1wanting the pain to stop so badly that she woke up 2for months to the thought, I want to die.  For me, it 3was a girl getting out her gun and laying it on the 4bed just to remind herself that she has control over 5her own life.  For me, it was a girl that spent so 6much time trying to fix herself that she forgot what 7she actually enjoys doing.  8Sexual abuse is so much more than 9disturbing physical acts.  It changes the trajectory 10of a victim's life, and that is something that no one 11has the right to do.  12Your Honor, with your permission, I would 13now like to address the defendant.  14THE COURT\", '  You may.15MS. STEPHENS', \"  After my parents confronted 16you, they brought you back to my house to speak with 17me.  Sitting on my living room couch I listened to 18you tell me no one should ever do that, and if they 19do, you should tell someone.  Well, Larry, I'm here, 20not to tell someone, but to tell everyone.  21You convinced my parents that I was a liar, 22that you didn't keep lotion strategically placed in 23the basement so you could beat your penis in my face 24while I hid.  But I still get sick at the smell of 259that lotion.  1You convinced my parents that you didn't 2pull my feet into your lap, unzip your pants, and rub 3your erect penis against my bare skin, but I still 4flinch when my feet are near someone's lap.  5You convinced my parents that you didn't 6stick your fingers in my adolescent vagina, but I 7knew when it was time to use my first tampon not to 8worry because my hymen wasn't intact.  9You used my body for six years for your own 10sexual gratification.  That is unforgiveable.  11I have been coming for you for a long time.  12I've told counselors your name in hopes that they 13would report you.  I have reported you to Child 14Protective Services twice.  I gave a testament to get 15your medical license revoked.  You were first 16arrested on my charges, and now as the only 17non-medical victim to come forward, I testify to let 18the world know that you are a repulsive liar and that 19those treatments were pathetically veiled sexual 20abuse.  21Perhaps you have figured it out by now, but 22little girls don't stay little forever.  They grow 23into strong women that return to destroy your world.  24Your Honor, there's no time that Larry 25105 of 57 sheetsPage 11 to 14 of 21702/13/2018 09\", '13', \"26 AMNassar can serve that will give me back those years 1with my family or the time and energy I spent sorting 2out my anger, frustration, and confusion.  But I can 3tell you this, our law does not do enough to prevent 4predatory acts and often does not do enough to punish 5predators who have committed the hideous acts of 6abuse of a child.  7I can also tell you Larry Nassar is a 8predator without boundaries.

Honorable Judge 2516Aquilina, thank you for giving me this opportunity to 1tell you how Larry Nassar has hurt me and the effect 2that this has had on my life. 3I am Jessica Thomashow, also known as 4victim A.  I was sexually assaulted by Larry Nassar 5when I was nine and 12 years old.  Today I am 17 and 6a senior in high school, and this is my story.  7My childhood was filled with happiness and 8love.  One of my loves was for gymnastics and for all 9my teammates in the gym.  Gymnastics was a big part 10of my childhood, and I spent many hours in the gym 11and at competitions, though, as you know, with 12gymnastics it is a very physically demanding sport 13and often comes with painful injuries.  14I remember one of my first injuries, a rib 15misplacement.  This was the first time I heard of 16Larry Nassar and his reputation.  I remember telling 17my mom that my coaches told me I should see Larry 18Nassar for my injury, and to my surprise, she knew 19who he was.  She had trained under him when she went 20to medical school at Michigan State University.  21One night my coaches arranged for me to see 22Nassar after practice to help with my rib injury.  23Monday nights were when Larry Nassar came to Twistars 24to treat injured team gymnasts.  I remember my 2517coaches telling me to go see him, and I was actually 1quite excited.  Then I went into the back room, and 2that's when everything changed.  3I was alone in the back room with him.  He 4had me lie down on the table and he sexually 5assaulted me.  He touched the most innocent places on 6my body that day.  7I remember fear and pain and asking myself, 8what is happening?  When it was over, I was so 9confused.  What had he just done to me, and why?  It 10was awful and embarrassing.  I left and kept the 11disgusting thing that had just happened to me to 12myself.  13Two years passed.  I saw him several times 14again at his clinic at MSU, always with my mom, and 15they were normal appointments.  Then in 2012 it 16happened again, right around my 12th birthday.  I had 17a stress fracture in my ankle and my dad took me to 18that appointment.  Before Nassar assaulted me, we had 19a great, meaningful conversation about my future.  He 20asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, and I 21said, I want to be just like you, a sports medicine 22doctor.  23He gave me a gift, a pin from the Olympics, 24and told me, when you take my place as the new sports 25187 of 57 sheetsPage 19 to 22 of 21702/13/2018 09\", '13', \"26 AMmedicine doctor for gymnastics, then you can give me 1back this pin.  Nassar then told my dad he had to 2massage my ankle and it would be okay for him to wait 3in the waiting room.  4After he left, Nassar told the medical 5student to leave the room, too.  After the room was 6cleared, he did it yet again.  He slid his ungloved 7hand up my leg and back into the most innocent part 8of my body, and I felt searing pain.  For 30 minutes 9he inserted his fingers into me and grunted while I 10lay there terrified.  11Again I was confused by what had just 12happened.  He was a trusted doctor and what he did to 13me didn't make sense in my child's mind.  I didn't 14tell a sole, and I try not to think about it anymore, 15but my dream of becoming a sports medicine doctor 16ended that day along with my happy and trusting self.  17He had broken me.  18I lived the next several years in limbo.  19Being sexually assaulted has changed me into an 20anxious teen, but I did not know that I had been 21abused and that was the source of my anxiety.  I no 22longer felt safe, and I had problems with trust.  23My parents took me to a psychiatrist and a 24therapist when I was in ninth grade and this 2519happened.  I was diagnosed with and treated for 1social anxiety disorder and saw a therapist on a 2weekly basis but did not have insight into the cause.  3In the seventh and eighth grade I felt 4extremely uncomfortable around my male teachers.  I 5avoided them.  I hated talking to them, and I would 6feel panic if I was ever alone with them in a room.  7Back then I didn't understand why I felt 8this way because all my peers loved our teachers, but 9being assaulted affected my relationship with my 10teachers and my anxiety was so intense that it made 11it hard to focus and learn at school.  12I also developed an intense fear of male 13hands, like a PTSD response.  Now I get flashbacks 14when I see male hands and it makes me feel scared and 15threatened.  This fear changed the way I grew up and 16how I related to boys.  I did not want to hold hands 17or ever be close to my guy friends.  I couldn't be 18just a normal girl anymore, and I have forever lost a 19big piece of my childhood due to his abuse.  20When the first IndyStar article came out my 21life changed.  I put the pieces together and realized 22I was molested by Larry Nassar.  I thought back to my 23appointments with him and could still feel what my 24nine and 12 year old self felt then; alone, scared, 2520and in pain.  I wanted to puke.  I could feel his 1hands touching me, and that was the first time I had 2my first flashback, and to this day I still have 3them.  The flashbacks are paralyzing.  I had one just 4two weeks ago at school and could barely get out of 5my seat.  Thankfully I was able to stop my brain and 6went to the office.  I cried for an hour shaking with 7fear.  8I would like to say something to my abuser, 9Larry Nassar.  10You took advantage of my innocence and 11trust.  You were my doctor and I trusted you and you 12took complete advantage of that.  Why?  I used to ask 13myself that question all the time, especially while I 14was laying in bed crying myself to sleep.  What you 15did to me was so twisted.  You manipulated me and my 16entire family.  How dare you.  17You had no right to do that, and because of 18your decision to molest me, you have caused so much 19pain in my life, and for the rest of my life I'm 20going to have to heal from what you did.  21Your Honor, I understand the plea 22guidelines are for a minimum sentence range of 25 to 2340 years, and I ask you to give Larry Nassar a 40 24year minimum to 125 year maximum sentence for what he 2521did to me.  I also ask on behalf of what he did to 1over a hundred other girls, we are all suffering 2having flashbacks, unable to have normal 3relationships, crying at night, feeling broken, and 4our lives have been forever changed.  He is a 5predator, and he won't be stopped unless he is behind 6bars for the rest of his life.  Thank you.  7THE COURT\", '  Are you asking for restitution?  8MS.

I 24am a minor and presently have not come forward with 2525my identity.  I am a sheltered Christian, 1home-schooled girl who is still in competitive 2gymnastics.  3From a young age I was raised to respect 4those in authority.  I was also taught that there are 5certain people who are there to help you; doctors, 6teachers, pastors, police officers, so going to see 7Nassar at the age of 13 it was -- that was my belief 8system, that he was there to help me.  9I can remember the first time he assaulted 10me like it was yesterday.  I cried all the way home 11because of what he did to me.  He made me feel so 12yucky that I could not imagine this is what I had to 13endure to get better.  But I was 13.  I had never 14heard of a doctor purposely hurting someone.  13 when 15this began happening and 15 when I realized what 16happened; 15, a sophomore, and now a junior in high 17school.  18What many people referred to as the best 19years of their life might have been the worst years 20of my life.  I can hardly explain what this past year 21and a half was like.  It was meetings and court 22appearances with attorneys, prosecutors, 23investigators, counselors.  It felt like endless 24meetings going back over a story that was so personal 25269 of 57 sheetsPage 27 to 30 of 21702/13/2018 09', '13', \"26 AMto talk about.  What 15 year old girl wants to 1discuss their private parts with grown men, or anyone 2for that matter?  It was embarrassing.  It was 3emotional, and I dreaded every meeting and court 4appearance I ever had to endure because it meant I 5was going to speak the assault out loud for everyone 6in the room.  Every time it forced me to relive the 7horrible experience again.  That was overwhelming.  8It caused sleepless nights, lots of stress 9because I was trying to balance school, competitive 10gymnastics, which is a lot of time and travel, and 11then this awful situation, all while trying to have 12somewhat of a normal teenage life.  13I did not want anyone to know.  I did not 14come out to my teammates and friends until right 15before I had to go to court in May.  Even right now I 16wrestled with lying to reveal my identity so that I 17no longer feel like I am hiding.  Plus, it would be 18nice to be able to say I'm a survivor.  But at the 19same time I am unsure.  I do not want anyone to look 20at my differently, especially when I walk out on the 21gymnastics floor.  I want to be known for who I am 22and my gymnastics, not for being a victim of Larry 23Nassar.  24This situation has also affected my family.  2527Being only 15 when I realized I was sexually 1assaulted my parents have been heavily involved.  2This has been extremely hard on my mom with lots of 3feeling of guilt for being in the room, for trusting, 4and for not asking enough questions.  She cries a 5lot, but she was determined to fight for justice for 6me and all the victims.  7My dad, it's just hard hearing the story 8over and over again.  Knowing what this monster did 9to his little girl makes him sick.  In front of me he 10tries to remain strong.  11My siblings have paid a price because it 12has often consumed our time and our days.  Part of 13our devastation is just knowing the time frame in 14which I was assaulted, starting in July 2014, knowing 15it could have been easily avoided.  If anyone -- if 16one or any of the stipulations had been enforced by 17anyone overseeing Nassar, this would have never 18happened.  To my knowledge, I am the first known 19victim after he was allowed to go back to work in 20July 2014.  That fact is almost inconceivable to us, 21that he was so brazen to do the sexual assault in 22front of my mom, but also knowing he was still under 23investigation.  It actually speaks volumes to what he 24knew he could get away with because no one was truly 2528watching.  He had mastered his performance, his act, 1his actions, his every move.  2To Larry Nassar, here are some of my 3thoughts.  You had it all, prestigious doctor, 4family, career, loved, worshipped by the gymnastics 5community, smart, honors, the list could go on and 6on, and you allowed evil to take over every part of 7you and committed some of the worst acts imaginable, 8on children.  The innocent, the trusting.  9I cannot even comprehend this at 16 years 10old.  I may not ever be able to comprehend what you 11did and what you threw away, all for your evil 12desires.  13Your apology/words at the hearing in 14November was not an apology.  If the judge gives you 15an opportunity to speak again before sentencing, you 16need to try again.  You need to sincerely apologize, 17not for the crazy words you spoke before about why 18you took the guilty plea, for the community to heal, 19that you never intended for this forest fire to get 20out of control.  Even at 16 years old I know those 21are silly statements.  It was not an apology to any 22victim or their family, but the victims need to hear 23you say I am sorry, please forgive me.  I made 24terrible decisions that were based on my own desires 2529with no regards of how I was hurting you that day and 1forever.  I manipulated so many people, all part of 2my scheme to be able to do what I ultimately wanted 3to do, and now I am begging, if you ever can, to 4forgive me for my disgusting actions.  Those are the 5types of sentences you need to say.  6Now I want you to know I stand today not as 7your judge, eventually that is God's job.  I stand 8today knowing that God's forgiveness extends to the 9worst offenses.  I stand today praying that God 10extends the same grace to you and that you reach out 11and take it, but you do need to ask him for it.  12I also stand today extending my forgiveness 13to you, not because you deserve it, but because our 14family will allow this tragic event to frame -- will 15not allow this tragic event to frame our lives, so we 16release this poison by extending forgiveness.  17Your Honor, what I want you to know -- what 18I want you to know most is I am only 16.  My whole 19life is ahead of me.  Most people as they grow up get 20to write their own story.  They make choices that 21affect the next days of their lives.  They make good 22choices and bad choices, but with each decision they 23are paving the way for their own stories.  They write 24it, their story.  253002/13/2018 09\", '13', \"26 AMPage 31 to 34 of 21710 of 57 sheetsHowever, I did not get to write my own 1story.  Someone wrote on my story.  Larry Nassar 2wrote on my story.  Without consent, without gloves, 3without prior explanation he wrote on my story, and 4it will always be a part of me.  5What my future holds is unknown.  How it 6will affect my relationships, schooling, decisions, 7trusts of others, especially doctors and men all is 8unknown.  I do not want this to defeat me, define me, 9outshine me, or confine me.  But it will always be a 10part of my story.  I still have a lot ahead.  What 16 11year old or anyone has to or wants to go through all 12of this?  13Just writing this statement has been 14stressful and emotional.  There are not enough words 15to convey my actual feelings.  Plus there seems to be 16endless things I could or want -- plus there seems to 17be endless things I could or want to say.  The list 18could go on forever.  19Even as I work on my statement with my mom, 20we cry.  As this settles I will turn the page and 21begin a new chapter, one that I will write myself.  I 22pray and trust the Lord will be all I need to sustain 23me from this affecting my story.  24Larry Nassar wrote his own story.  He made 2531decisions, awful disgusting decisions, and those 1decisions should affect the rest of his life.  We do 2not want him to ever have a chance to write on 3anyone's story.  4You now have the unique opportunity, one 5that you have earned, to be able to write on his 6story.  My family and I have prayed for you.  We have 7prayed that your sentence is the maximum number of 8years but within the parameters of what the Attorney 9General and prosecutor have established.  As you 10write on his story, please remember that you are 11writing on behalf of all the victims whose stories 12Larry Nassar wrote on.

MARKHAM\", \"  No.  She couldn't be with us 18today but I'm going to be telling you from a victim's 19mother's point of view what our life has been like 20since her abuse from Larry Nassar, but I first wanted 21to tell you that my daughter was adopted from South 22Korea and I got a call from our social worker that 23wanted to know if we would be willing to take a baby 24that had some medical issues in August of 1985, and 2535we said, yes, and at that time she -- we picked her 1up at the airport and she had a fractured skull and 2she -- both of her ears were damaged.  She was 3delivered in a hospital using forceps and she 4required several surgeries, but for a whole year I 5sat up with this baby at night because she couldn't 6lay down, and the bond that came from her and I was 7just inseparable.  We did everything together as she 8continued to grow up.  9Her childhood was a normal childhood and 10she wouldn't leave my side, and I needed to get her 11to be social with other kids so I enrolled her in 12Montessori, and for a whole week she screamed like a 13pig being cut because she thought I was leaving her, 14and finally on the fifth day she said, mommy, I know 15you'll be back.  I said, yes, I will.  16I'm sorry.  During her normal childhood 17she, you know, wanted to do all the activities that 18all her little friends did, and we had these Saturday 19morning classes and the gymboree and the whatever, 20swim lessons, and so she really caught on to 21gymnastics, and she was enrolled at Artistic 22Gymnastics Academy in Roseville, Michigan, and her 23Saturday morning hour classes turned into several 24times a week, and then the coaches asked her if she 2536would like to join team and I said, well, it's going 1to be her decision but she needed to understand the 2requirements and that she needed to understand the 3commitment of what it meant and the dedication, and 4she said, yes, this is what she wanted to do 5Well, that became five days a week, 6sometimes six, and she was made -- she went to team 7really quick because she was really good.  8However, during -- she took a fall off of 9the beam and she injured her lower back and I asked 10our coach, I said, who should we go see?  And at this 11time she was ten years old.  And so -- and this was 12in 1995.  And so they said, you know, go -- they 13referred us to Larry Nassar, and I said, okay.  14Well, at the time we really didn't know, 15you know, much about him other than his medical 16reputation, so we went to see him and we traveled all 17the way from the east side of Michigan to Lansing, 18you know, several times a month for treatment. 19The last time that we went to treatment she 20was at that time 12 years old, and we had this thing, 21her and I, that we would, after her doctor visit, we 22would go to this little cafe in East Lansing and have 23lunch and enjoy each other for a while before we had 24that long drive back home, and so we got in the 2537car -- and I had been in the room with her during her 1examination, as usual, and I said, are you ready to 2go to lunch and she's, like, no, mom, I just want to 3go home.  And I said, what's wrong?  Are you in pain?  4And she said, mom, I just want to go home.  And I 5said, okay.  6So we got in the car and I said -- and she 7started bawling and I said, Chelsey, tell me what's 8wrong.  And she said, mom, he put his fingers in me 9and they weren't gloved, and I said, Chelsey, I was 10right there in the room, and she goes, you couldn't 11see what was going on, mom.  And she said, he hurt 12me.  And I said, Chelsey, we're going back right now.  13And I -- I mean, I was literally going to drive 14across the median on 96, and she said, mom, please 15don't do that.  I said, why?  And she said, because 16you don't understand, everybody will know, and 17everybody will judge me, and the judges will know 18when I compete, and I said, Chelsey, I can't do that, 19I have to go back.  Mom, please, we'll just find 20another doctor, and she begged me, and she was 21hysterical.  And I said, okay.  You know, I said, 22I'll talk to your dad about it, but I may end up 23going back, Chels.  24So she went back to the gym the next day 253802/13/2018 09\", '13', \"26 AMPage 39 to 42 of 21712 of 57 sheetsand I told her coach -- his name was Tim, and I told 1Tim about it, and he said, oh, no, that couldn't have 2happened.  I've known Larry for years.  And I said, 3well, Tim, it did happen.  So I told him I just 4wanted him to know what had happened.  So when I went 5into the balcony and was sitting with the rest of the 6moms, I said, You know, did any of your girls see 7Larry Nassar for treatment and a couple of them said, 8yes, and they said -- I said, did anything -- did 9they ever say anything about unusual behavior on his 10part?  And they said, well, no.  You know, they give 11me this look like you're lying to me, but anyways, 12that was neither here nor there at the time because 13they weren't going to say anything.  14So we started a path of destruction, and 15her path of destruction was -- she was doing horrible 16in school.  She had this self loathing.  I had her 17see a psychiatrist and it didn't seem to be helping.  18There was a lot of self blame.  She had managed to 19get through -- she had quit gymnastics the following 20year when she was 13 because she went to a meet here 21in Lansing at Twistars, I believe it was, and he was 22there and she fell off of every apparatus, she did 23horrible, and she said, I can't do this anymore 24because every time I see him I just flash back to 2539what happened in his office. 1She made bad decisions.  It affected her 2social life.  She started running with bad crowds.  3She got into drugs and she never really recovered.  4The person that was my best friend, we used to do 5everything together, we would watch movies, we both 6loved movies -- as a matter of fact, I hate to admit 7it but on a rainy day we went to see four movies and 8only paid for one, but we would bake cookies 9together, and she loved the holidays, and she would 10decorate the house and I didn't have to do anything.  11She just kind of, like, took over.  12So she did come out of it a little bit.  13She had suffered a rape at a concert, that was 14another thing that compounded her issues.  I think 15the thing that her -- the worst part for her was that 16this was a man that was supposed to be the best in 17his field.  He was supposed to help her.  He was 18supposed to help her heal.  But he didn't.  He abused 19her.  He sexually abused her, and he had the audacity 20to do that while I was sitting right there in the 21room.  22I know that the other girls have similar 23stories.  We all have the same story, but for my 24daughter it just became a serious, serious bought of 2540depression, and so in 2009 she took her own life 1because she couldn't deal with the pain anymore, and 2it will be ten years in March that I lost my baby.  3She was 23 years old.  She would have been 33 now.  4And every day I miss her.  Every day.  And it all 5started with him.  It all started with him.  It just 6became worse as the years went by until she couldn't 7deal with it anymore.  8And you don't know what it's like to be at 9work and get a call to come home immediately, and you 10know, a mother's instinct tells you something is 11wrong, and you pull up in your driveway and the 12medical examiner is there and your daughter is in a 13body bag and they're loading her into the van.  14It has destroyed our family.  We used to be 15so close.  My husband and I -- I went through four 16years of intense therapy trying to deal with all of 17this until I could finally accept the fact that this 18was not my fault.  It was the fault of Larry Nassar 19that started all this with my daughter, and as you 20can see, she turned into a beautiful young lady who 21was really, really sick.  And that's my story for 22her.  23THE COURT\", \"  Ma'am, I am so very sorry for 24the loss of your beautiful daughter.  I know she's 2541with you now and proud of your words on her behalf.  1MS.

CAPUA', \"  Your Honor, life through a 21child's eyes is a place where bad things don't make 22sense.  Rarely do you see or hear a child that 23doesn't smile at the thought of life.  A child is 24just what I was, a 13 year old who didn't see the 2544world as a terrifying place, not until I was faced 1with the life changing experience that stole my 2innocence far too young.  Not until the day that you, 3Mr. Nassar, violated the right to be called a doctor 4and took something from I and all of the other strong 5women that stand behind me today. 6I was in a state of great desperation when 7I paid my visit to Doctor Nassar, or as he liked his 8patients to refer to him, Larry.  Prior to my visit I 9had been recommended by gymnastic coaches.  I heard 10words such as, you'll love him.  He's a miracle 11worker.  He can fix anyone or anything.  12Thinking back to these words filling my 13naive mind, all I can think of is how this man, 14someone who held so many high credentials, was the 15monster who left me with more pain and scars than I 16came to his office with, the pain of never trusting 17someone physically again and the scars of being 18touched and exposed in places that were completely 19inappropriate.  20That day in the office is a day that will 21never be forgotten.  My family and I drove from 22Naperville, Illinois, to Mr. Nassar's office at the 23Michigan State facility in Lansing, Michigan.  I 24can't begin to explain the feeling I had moments 2545after this immoral act had been performed.  1I got a moment to myself after the assault 2when I sat in the bathroom at the facility.  I sat 3there in great disbelief, complete shock, and total 4humiliation.  I couldn't fathom the idea of what had 5just occurred.  6There isn't a day that goes by since July 71st, 2013, that I don't cringe at the disturbing 8violation that this man had put me through.  This 9horrific headline had finally reached the media three 10years later of too many girls losing something that 11should have never been stolen; innocence, privacy, 12safety, and trust.  13One day about three weeks after this had 14initially hit the news I was sitting in English class 15and we were discussing the meaning of the word 16depravity.  This word means wickedness or performing 17immorally corrupt acts.  The example my English 18teacher gave to further explain this disturbing word 19was this.  One day about -- excuse me.  The other day 20I saw in the news that an Olympic gymnastic doctor 21had -- that was the moment I was dreading, that 22moment where I had become the victim of a 23heartbreaking news story that my English teacher was 24casually discussing in class.  Of course, she was 254602/13/2018 09\", '13', \"26 AMPage 47 to 50 of 21714 of 57 sheetsunaware.  Everyone was.  My face was filled with 1terror and panic as soon as the words Olympic 2gymnastic doctor filled the room.  I sat in my desk 3shaking as if I was back in that office being 4violated.  5I previously described how this event stole 6my innocence, and that is what carries with me to 7this day.  For years I was afraid to give myself and 8my trust to anyone.  I wasn't willing to be heard 9again.  I had tried to hold on to every bit of 10innocence I felt I had left.  I was terrified to date 11anyone because I knew that physically and mentally I 12couldn't get past this internal barrier.  I was 13afraid to lose myself to another person who didn't 14deserve it.  15Last year I found someone who took me in 16and handled me with great care.  I learned to trust 17his loving arms and appreciate the endless love he 18had for me despite my intimacy issues.  I finally 19feel as though I got my innocence back.  I gained 20back what I lost unexpectedly, and I'm grateful for 21that every day.  22I'm speaking on behalf of all the girls who 23experienced this tragedy, whether it was one time or 24multiple times.  Once is far too much to be put 2547through.  Some may be scared to share their 1experience.  I was.  I still am sometimes.  There are 2some days that this horrifying experience fills my 3brain and I can't think about anything else.  4It left a mental scar that unfortunately 5will always be something that happened.  However, I 6am a strong believer that wounds heal into scars and 7these scars become stories that you share and heal 8from each day as time goes on.  A voice must be heard 9in order for all these victims of this tragic event 10to reach a level of closure.  Justice must be served.  11I am speaking to all the parents out there, 12including my own, who could have been in the very 13room that this event happened but was manipulated 14into believing that Mr. Nassar was healing us, as any 15normal doctor is supposed to do.  You are not to 16blame.  I can tell you that the thought of, well, if 17my parents would have just done, has never crossed my 18brain, and I can speak of other daughters who 19experienced this as well.  20To all the significant others of these 21girls, nothing means more to them than the way you 22love them and show them how to love themselves.  That 23is only going to help us heal, so thank you to both 24parents and significant others for going through 2548these horrifying events with us and being there as a 1shoulder to cry on or a hand to squeeze tight.  2To all the girls that have shown so much 3bravery throughout this, I could not be more proud of 4each and every one of you.  Although I may not know 5each of you personally, I can stand here and say that 6you are all my heroes.  7Lastly, a few words to Mr. Larry Nassar.  8You broke and shattered a lot of girls.  You 9manipulated us to trust you because you're a doctor 10and doctors do no wrong, only heal.  You are not a 11healer.  You performed acts of depravity just as my 12English teacher described.  You are also the one that 13must face what you have done for the rest of your 14life.  I am no longer broken by you.  15Every day I grow a new strength and look 16into the mirror to see a strong, unbreakable person.  17Nothing will ever take away what you have done to me 18or to the others that stand behind me.  However, we 19can walk free and radiate the strength that we have 20gained from your horrific acts, something you will 21never be able to do.  22Although I no longer see the world through 23a child's eyes, I have become this powerful 24individual that is taking this opportunity to speak 2549for what I believe in.  I am not the only one who 1suffered from these acts, and I know that this is not 2an easy thing to hear.  The fact of the matter is 3that it doesn't matter if this topic is uncomfortable 4to listen to or discuss.  It is something that 5happened and needs to be addressed,6I am hopeful that this letter not only 7speaks to those in this room or those involved with 8this case but to anyone who hears of these headlines.  9These acts were completely immoral and horrific and I 10am confident that Mr. Nassar will get what he 11deserves.  In the meantime, I hope that the effects 12that this tragedy has had on young girls is strong 13enough to make a change.  14Initially when I was asked if I wanted to 15remain anonymous when I read my letter today I 16immediately thought, yes.  This is something about me 17that I have always been afraid to share with people.  18I couldn't help but fear that people were going to 19look at my differently when this was nothing -- this 20was something that I did not ask to happen to me.  21After thinking about it and taking time to cope with 22facing this fear of mine I decided to finally put a 23name to it.  I am Jade Capua, and I am a survivor.  24Thank you.  255015 of 57 sheetsPage 51 to 54 of 21702/13/2018 09\", '13', '26 AMTHE COURT', \"  Yes, you are, ma'am.

Sadly, as you recognized and the other 5victims have recognized, you're not alone in this.  6It happens all the time and, unfortunately, here it 7was with a trusted doctor who shouldn't have been 8trusted.  9I can also see as you read your 10statement -- I know you don't have eyes in the back 11of your head, but I watched the faces of your 12parents.

MOORE', \"  December 16, 2016, I woke up 13from a nightmare sweating yet chilled to the core.  I 14knew before months of defending the mastermind I knew 15I was one of them.  That afternoon thousands of 16graphic images were found on multiple computers and 17media devices.  I still think about that daily.  18For years Mr. Nassar convinced me that he 19was the only person who could help me recover from 20multiple serious injuries.  To me he was like a 21knight in shining armor.  But, alas, that shine 22blinded me from the abuse.  He betrayed my trust, 23took advantage of my youth, and sexually abused me 24hundreds of times.  For this I believe that Mr. 2552Nassar deserves the maximum sentence for which his 1actions deserve.  2As a nation we need to take control.  3Sexual offenders need to know that they cannot 4continue with the crimes they are committing, and 5that no matter how long it takes for a survivor to 6come forward, their crimes will be exposed and their 7actions will be admonished.  8Sexual assault and harassment should not be 9a part of our culture.  Mr. Nassar should never be 10allowed to look at, talk to, or touch another young 11person again.  12I was an innocent nine year old with a 13broken pelvis that was willing to trust and allowed 14the doctor to do anything to help it feel better.  I 15had no reason not to.  He treated a few of my 16cousins.  He was friends with my mom and aunts.  He 17had pictures of Olympians and thank you notes from 18floor to ceiling in that MSU Sports Medicine office.  19I gazed at them during every appointment.  I knew the 20story behind many of the portraits, he shared them 21with me.  I was the 18 year old preparing to go away 22to college, apprehensive, and just hoping my body 23would be able to withstand four more years of the 24sport that defined my life.  Ten years of abuse and 2553neglect.  1I don't like the word victim.  Being a 2victim implies the desire for pity.  I am a survivor, 3but more so, I am me, and those ten years are a part 4of my story.  They have helped to define who I am 5today.  Today I am more guarded than I was a year ago 6but I also am wiser and more aware.  Today it is my 7job to be an even better role model and mentor and to 8be an advocate in saying that this does not define 9the sport of gymnastics or the medical profession.  10I have the honor of working with young 11girls every day.  They listen to what I say, get 12notifications every time I post to Instagram, analyze 13what I do, pick up on my vocabulary and copy how I 14dress.

It is my job to teach these girls that 17they can be the most powerful, amazing, and 18influential humans if they so choose and to help them 19realize that they have a voice and they have the 20ability to stand up for what they believe in.  It is 21my job to ensure that every nine year old I work with 22knows that she has an amazing future ahead of her and 23to ensure that every 18 year old I know realizes that 24she has the power to define who she is, that no 255402/13/2018 09\", '13', \"26 AMPage 55 to 58 of 21716 of 57 sheetsmatter what she goes through she will always have 1people in her corner, and she should have faith to 2help her get through it.  3It is not my job to point out the flaws in 4the system and what others could have done to protect 5myinnocence.  That truth will one day be exposed.  6But it is my job to make a difference and an impact 7on the world and to help stop monster-like humans 8from abusing their power.  9I am working on forgiving you, Mr. Nassar.  10One day I will be able to, but I will never forget 11what you have done.  I must ask you this, are you 12remorseful for your actions in all of the lives you 13have changed forever?  Do you regret misusing your 14medical dominance?  I could hear it in your voice 15that November day when you pled guilty.  You are 16sorry for the pain that you have caused.  You had the 17same sincerity as you told me the story of why you 18blame yourself for sweet ********** birth story, as 19you hugged me at your brother Mike's funeral, and all 20of those times you told me I just needed to rest and 21could not compete.  22Saying that you did nothing for me would be 23a lie.  You helped to heal me.  My fragile bones, 24that is.  You shared your knowledge and gave me some 2555invaluable advice, but you also abused your power and 1mytrust in you, and that is not okay.  2My love for humanity is greater than the 3fear of the unknown.  My voice is louder than my 4inner thoughts.  My hope for change is more 5prevailing than my desire to ask why me, why was I 6the nine year old?  7This past year I have had countless somber 8days and incredibly long sleepless nights.  I 9clenched my jaws as I heard strangers wonder how he 10really did what he did and turn the other way as I 11saw her face on the front page of the newspapers in 12the gas station.  I have held back tears when friends 13ask how I was holding up.  I have looked into my 14parents' hardened eyes, seeing their pain from now 15knowing that their only child was molested right in 16front of them in the same room.  When no one is 17around I have cried and sobbed, felt a rush of every 18emotion and solidified my belief that I have the most 19amazing family and an incredible circle of friends.  20And I have had to think through and talk 21about the hundreds, hundreds of appointments and 22Nassar home visits and cringe at all of the times I 23should have said something about the improper 24treatments and oath breaking moments.  But I didn't, 2556and I cannot look back anymore.  1I am determined to be more involved in 2making this world a better place.  I can use my 3voice, my education, and my experiences to help stop 4females and males alike for not standing up for 5themselves and others.

I can still remember the feeling of 14disbelief last October when I realized that what I 15had thought was medical treatment over ten years ago 16was actually sexual abuse.  17This case has taken all of me, every ounce 18of my being to press forward.  The world that we live 19in does not allow time to heal, and it never will.  20Life continues to come at lightening speed.  My 21career continues to demand my very best, and my 22family responsibilities do not take a time out.  23What's left is a tank on empty due to the 24emotional stress of the afterlife of what you have 255817 of 57 sheetsPage 59 to 62 of 21702/13/2018 09\", '13', \"26 AMdone.  My children and my husband get less than my 1best due to the many sleepless nights and layered 2days of scratching and clawing to stay afloat.  3Prior to realizing what you had done to me 4I was a woman who once woke up each day with a smile, 5positive attitude, and end the day with just enough 6leftover energy to play with my children and 7successfully put a mark on another day.  I gave 8humans the benefit of earning my trust and most often 9took the time to see good in most people 10The past year has been nothing like those 11times.  My days start with exhaustion from a less 12than restful night's sleep and they end with fatigue 13from all the distractions and emotions that fill each 14day.  15I have always believed that I can 16accomplish whatever life throws my way with a restful 17night's sleep, and I cannot sleep because of what you 18have done.  I have made jokes in the past saying that 19I've never witnessed a bad's night sleep and for that 20I was forever grateful for God giving me the ability 21to sleep soundly.  Over the last year I have cried 22more nights than not and I have experienced flashback 23nightmares of the abuse.  I've woken up from such bad 24nightmares that I vomit.  The anxiety this has caused 2559me is what leaves me feeling like there is nothing 1more to give.  2Today I am a mother, a wife, a daughter, 3and friend that is struggling each day to find peace 4and joy in all things that once made me happy.  5Conversations are overtaken by Larry Nassar and the 6obvious pain in my voice is hard to avoid.  Those 7that truly know me know I will never be the same.  8November of last year I began seeing a 9therapist for what I now know is post-traumatic 10stress disorder.  My deepest pain and fear was the 11thought of my two young daughters ever being hurt 12like this.  The fear that invoked was crippling.  I 13was unable to send my children to daycare due to the 14paralyzing anxiety I was experiencing.  And birthday 15parties, sleep-overs, large crowds of people steal 16the joy of creating memories with my family.  Some 17day I will have to explain to my children why I am 18the way I am, my reasons for being cautious and 19fearful.  20My career has suffered tremendously from 21the distractions and the pain I am feeling.  There's 22not a day that passes that I don't think about the 23monster that created this mess.  The checklist of 24what needs to get done has never been harder to 2560accomplish and some days the details seem like a 1nearly impossible task.  2My mind is full of what is my new reality 3and my heart is aching from not being able to trust 4anybody around me.  For the past year I've held back 5with those that I love most.  I have become withdrawn 6from my every day life.  Life seems to be moving at a 7speed that I cannot keep up with and my peace of mind 8is forever taken away.  9I will always sacrifice myself as a parent.  10I went from once trusting full-heartedly to now not 11being able to trust at all.  The hardest battle I 12will continue to face is even in the situations you 13feel most safe, you can never let your guard down.  14If you can't trust a world-renowned doctor, who in 15this world can you trust?  16These feelings don't just stop from the 17abuse of Larry Nassar.  As if the struggle of what 18Larry Nassar did isn't bad enough, it's horrifying 19that MSU and USA Gymnastics are not stepping up to 20the plate to admit their wrongdoing.  21I have gone from a raving fan of MSU to now 22seeing green and white in the very same way as I do 23Larry Nassar.  I want MSU and USAG to know what they 24have done is on the very same level of accountability 2561as the crime Nassar has committed.  I strongly 1believe that MSU and USAG's inaction places an 2accountability on them for Nassar's access to minors 3which led to sexual abuse.  4MSU knew what was being done to these 5athletes and decided to turn a blind eye to keep 6their reputation strong and their pockets full.  If 7they would have only taken action upon the reporting, 8they would have saved me and all of these other women 9standing before us today from an afterlife full of 10pain and agony.  11As to what we now know of USAG, paying out 12to keep quiet is beyond my wildest dreams of wrong.  13Shame on you for looking the other way when this was 14brought to your attention.  15I'd like to take a moment to comment on MSU 16Board of Trustees as well as the president of MSU, 17Lou Anna Simon.  How convenient that you decided not 18to attend today.  You are a coward and your decision 19to watch from the sidelines is perfect representation 20of your lack of leadership.  21It sickens me that for 16 months you 22allowed Larry Nassar to continue to see young 23children under your guidance while he was under 24investigation for sexual abuse.  Now that this is a 256202/13/2018 09\", '13', \"26 AMPage 63 to 66 of 21718 of 57 sheetspublic matter you put out a blanket statement as your 1sincere apology.  Have you ever thought to pick up 2the phone to apologize to your victims?  Have you 3ever thought to pick -- oh, sorry.  It would only 4make sense for you to speak directly to the victims 5to seek a better understanding of what had happened.  6Not once have you reached out to gather information 7or to ask how we are doing.  8We see how you're handling this matter, and 9I can tell you from a mother's experience that I 10expect better effort from my two young children.  A 11public apology after you hid behind this monster for 12over 20 years will never be enough.  13Where were you when we needed you?  If you 14would have only listened to all the women that 15brought complaints and concerns over all these years 16this would have saved so many children and women from 17being abused and from all the scars this has created.  18You have apologized for him and for the 19horrible things he has done.  That is not enough.  At 20what point will you look at yourselves in the mirror 21and realize that taking ownership of this matter is 22the only way to truly bring about change.  Until 23then, I will continue to fight for real answers.  24Lou Anna Simon and the board of trustees, 2563all the signs were there.  The complaints should have 1been enough for you to open your eyes and ears and to 2ensure that there was intentional follow through 3involved to protect the women under your care.  You 4failed all of us, and for that I see you in the same 5category of criminal as I do the criminal standing 6before us today.  7On the other hand, I am beyond grateful for 8the sentence Nassar received.  60 painful years of 9prison life surely brings relief to me.  Knowing you 10will never have the opportunity to hurt another human 11being is reassuring.  12As for the people at MSU and USAG, just 13know we will continue to fight to ensure that you're 14held accountable for not protecting young girls under 15your care from this day forward.  162018 brings newness for myself and my 17family.  Even though I will never be the same, I will 18continue to fight for trust, love, and, most of all, 19peace of mind.  I will slowly but surely begin to 20feel, to feel the joy of new experiences with my 21children, reconnect with friends who over the last 22year have gotten less than my best.  I will make 23strides to love with an untainted heart that is ready 24for new beginnings.  2564The pain will never fully pass from what 1you and the irresponsible organizations have done to 2myself and many others.  There's still so much 3uncertainty in life, but one thing is for sure, I 4will continue to press forward to seek what was once 5happiness.  I will educate my children about monsters 6like you and pray to God they will never experience 7pain like this.  There will be a day when I look into 8my soul and I will still see the scars of this 9nightmare, but I will no longer feel the deepness of 10your pain.  The scars will remind me that the past is 11real but the future is bright.  Thank you.  12THE COURT\", \"  Thank you for being here.

Because I hear so many vile 1cases I'm a bit overprotective, and my middle child 2calls herself Rapunzel because of me, because I only 3let her out after I carefully examine everything, and 4she does not like that, but my daughter also 5expressed a desire to be here and to hear your words 6and the words of the other victims, and I know that 7she's not the only teenager who wants to hear what 8you have to say, and so coming from you instead of 9me, from the parent she doesn't want to listen to, is 10so critical, and your children, too, will not only 11have your voice as the mother, even if they choose 12like my daughter to disregard my words, because all 13of you have come here together in strength.  She will 14be reassured, both your daughters -- they're girls, 15right?  Yes.  They'll both be reassured that your 16voice is one of hundreds and that you are right, so I 17think they will listen.  I actually pray and know 18they will listen because of your sincerity, and 19because being here today you have saved so many other 20victims and other voices will rise.

MARK\", \"  Not playing was not an option, 22and my parents were obviously concerned, and through 23my mom's connections with MSU I was able to get an 24appointment with Larry.  2568I saw Larry once.  I remember him doing a 1scan on my body as I stood straight up in his office 2where he poked and prodded at me and he made various 3observations about my muscles and bone structure, et 4cetera.  My mom was in the room.  I was really into 5sports and, honestly, it was interesting to hear such 6a thorough examination of my body.  7After the standing examination was done 8Larry asked me to lay down on the exam table and he 9positioned himself so that he was between my 10midsection and where my mom was sitting so she 11couldn't see what was happening.  He kept prodding at 12and manipulating my legs and hips and stomach and at 13some point he said he was going to move his hands 14close to my vagina.  I've thought a lot about that 15statement in hindsight and I see now how devious and 16how practiced it must have been for him.  My mom knew 17this doctor would be getting close so no cause for 18concern, and I was expecting something to happen but 19I didn't know what.  I had absolutely no other 20medical or personal experience against which to 21compare what he was about to do, and he didn't talk 22me through what he was doing, so he molested me and 23he molested me with my mom in the room.  24My mom and I talked about the appointment 2569afterwards but I didn't really have the words for 1what Larry had done, and as a 15 year old girl I was 2embarrassed to talk to adults about something like 3that.  I had never seen a gynecologist.  I never had 4a pap smear, and at the time I thought this is what 5it meant to be a woman going to the doctors, awkward 6and embarrassing and uncomfortable but just part of 7the deal.  Besides, I thought he was looking out for 8me.  9It's been about 18 years since my 10appointment, and in that 18 years I have never had 11another health professional come close to touching me 12the way that he did.  At the time I had a sense that 13it was a strange appointment and if the university or 14police or someone actually looking to find something 15had asked either my mom or I about the experience, 16they would have put together a pattern of him acting 17far outside of normal behavior for a doctor, but no 18one asked us, and so after me, Larry had another 16 19odd years to molest and assault young women and 20girls.  21It sickens me to know that I was on the 22early side of his abuse.  He used those early 23appointments with people like my mom and I as a test 24case to see how far he could push the patient/doctor 257002/13/2018 09\", '13', \"26 AMPage 71 to 74 of 21720 of 57 sheetstrust for his own instant gratification, and it makes 1mefeel so disgusted and weak that I was part of his 2learning process, to know that he was doing that to 3other girls at the time who were hurting just as much 4as I was and who just wanted to get better, and to 5know that he took what her learned from those 6appointments like mine and he went on to abuse so 7many young women and girls for the next 16 years.  8I knew that Larry Nassar molested me when I 9read the article in the IndyStar.  This last year and 10a half is about coming to terms with how naive and 11vulnerable I was.  I feel very stupid for not 12understanding what was happening at the time, really 13guilty for not contributing in some way to stop it 14sooner, and really, really emotional and vulnerable, 15but I also feel really lucky because I got to go 16through high school and I got to go through college 17and dating and I got to meet my future husband only 18thinking it was a weird doctor's appointment.  It's 19just in the last year that I've had to come to terms 20with what happened, but even in the last year it has 21changed me.  Larry's later victims knew they were 22victims at a much younger age so beyond molesting 23them, as you heard today, he's also robbed them of 24the innocence and carefree-ness that's supposed to 2571come with that time in our life.  1After today I don't plan to think about 2Larry unless I absolutely have to.  I get to keep 3living.  I get to keep looking forward to the future 4and what's next.  I get to keep having an incredibly 5rich and fulfilling life, and so do the other women 6who are here today, and so do the other women who 7haven't necessarily stepped forward, but that's not 8what he gets, and that's where I get my justice.  I'd 9like Larry to sit in prison for a very long time with 10no hope for what's next.11I also want to say I was abused once a long 12time ago.  I did not understand it was abuse until I 13was an adult, and even with that, this past year has 14still been a very emotional and trying time.  I can't 15imagine how difficult it's been for the charging 16victims.  17I don't want the women and families who 18testified against Larry to have to go through that 19again unless they want to, which is why I hope that 20even though these crimes warrant a lifetime or more 21in prison, you sentence Larry to the highest minimum 22of 40 years so that the plea deal is not jeopardized.23And I also want to close by saying thank 24you to you, to Detective Andrea Munford, to Rebekah 2572Snyder, Angela Povilaitis, to Rachael and IndyStar 1for shining a light on this and for the other women 2who stepped forward to end the abuse.  I know that it 3took a lot of people to catch and prosecute this 4person, and I appreciate the network that it's taken 5to get here.  Thank you.  6THE COURT\", \"  I appreciate you being here.  7That wasn't just a weird doctor appointment, it was a 8criminal doctor appointment, and I'm very sorry that 9no one caught up sooner.

However, I truly believe that even if I 20would have recognized the abuse and come forward 21several years ago, we would still be in this very 22same place today.  23Even as a 31 year old it was extremely 24uncomfortable to describe to my family and my parents 257421 of 57 sheetsPage 75 to 78 of 21702/13/2018 09', '13', \"26 AMthe graphic details of what you did to me.  Each time 1I had to describe it, whether to the police, my 2attorneys, my therapist, or in writing, it doesn't 3get any easier.  Having to relive my experiences over 4and over almost 20 years later brings back so many 5memories and emotions.  I even avoid talking to -- 6talking about it with those close to me because I get 7closed off and irritable.  8The fact that I was sexually abused by you 9is something that I'm still wrapping my head around.  10One of the hardest parts is seeing my parents carry 11any sense of responsibility for what happened because 12it is in no way their fault.  It's your fault.  13We all trusted Larry and are angry for the 14way you deceived us.  He's made it difficult to trust 15anyone.  The flashbacks of the hours spent alone in 16that exam room with him have at times kept me up at 17night.  My memories are vivid and it's hard to get 18images out of my head.  I remember how much it hurt 19but didn't want to speak up because I was afraid of 20what you would think of me.  I had to be strong.  21When I told my mom that it hurt, she 22thought I was referring to the pain in my back, not 23the pain in my vagina from the excruciating hours of 24assault that just took place.  2575For the first time in my life I sought 1therapy because I've realized this is something that 2I am not able to deal with on my own.  My therapist 3has helped me find ways to cope with my anxiety and 4emotions, but, more importantly, she's helped me to 5stop blaming myself.  6Larry, you are the one that should feel 7guilt and shame every day and have to live with that 8for the rest of your life.  Unfortunately, we as 9victims and survivors have to live with the damage 10you have caused for the rest of our lives, too.  11Your Honor, I'm asking for the full 12sentence set by the Attorney General's office because 13I am a hundred percent confident that if he had not 14been caught, he would continue to do this for the 15rest of his life.

I will.  I will make up my mind in a few days 6at sentencing when it comes to that stage, and I want 7everyone to know I'm going to honor the plea deal 8because I think everybody needs closure, not because 9I necessarily am happy with it, but the combined 10sentences I think will put your mind at ease, and 11hopefully you can trust the system, and I trust that 12you're going to have a very happy, fulfilled life.  13Thank you again for being here.14MS.

Kate, K-a-t-e, Mahon, 7M-a-h-o-n.8When I first learned about Larry Nassar I 9could not believe it.  I talked with my parents and 10sister and thought the women that reported the sexual 11assault must be mistaken.  Even though I did not know 12this at the time, I had also gone through the same 13abuse beginning when I was 15 years old.  Today I 14know I was in the first stage of grief, denial.  15Denial that I could ever be a victim of sexual 16assault.  I was grieving that a person I respected 17and cared for had betrayed my trust, grieving the 18realization that I was sexually assaulted as a child.  19Prior to and even after my unfortunate 20contact with Larry Nassar I thought of myself as 21someone that was good at reading people.  However, 22Larry Nassar is a master manipulator.  His conniving 23and calculating behavior not only tricked me but he 24tricked my mom who was present for all my 257802/13/2018 09', '13', \"26 AMPage 79 to 82 of 21722 of 57 sheetsappointments as a minor.  1After discovering the assault had taken 2place, my family and I were distraught with grief.  3My mom blamed herself and felt she should have asked 4more questions and been more guarded and skeptical 5about procedures.  The thought of my mom hurting and 6blaming herself was heartbreaking for me because 7never once did I think it was her fault.  8Anyone that has suffered sexual assault or 9loves someone who has needs to realize it's not their 10fault.  It is the sexual predator's fault, and in 11this case it is Larry Nassar's fault.  12Even though I accepted this abuse was out 13of my control to prevent, it has not lessened my 14depression and anxiety.  There are nights I lie awake 15crying, fearful of the nightmares that may come when 16I fall asleep, and when I'm awake the nightmare of 17this reality, my reality, is not much better.  18Not only am I depressed with the 19realization of what happened to me, I've had to go on 20living my same life with family and friends that have 21no idea what I'm going through.  Usually I'm a very 22outgoing and open person, but it's been difficult to 23be my true self without sharing this part of my past.  24What motivates me to come forward is my 2579strong belief that victims of sexual assault deserve 1to have a voice.  By publicly speaking out against 2Larry Nassar I'm not just speaking out for myself, 3I'm speaking out for all the girls and women of the 4past, present, and future that have been or will be 5affected by sexual assault 6A quote from Jasmin Kaur\", \"  Scream so that 7one day a hundred years from now another sister will 8not have to dry her tears wondering where in history 9she lost her voice.  10It's been a difficult road, to say the 11least, but I know in my heart our efforts will help 12women not only today but for years to come.  13Difficult times can either strengthen or break a 14person.  15I am proud to say that this experience, 16though extremely challenging and sometimes 17unbearable, has made me a stronger woman than I was 18before.  Through this strength I have learned to not 19be ashamed.  The only ones that should be ashamed are 20Larry Nassar and the institutions that enabled him 21and denied responsibility.  22I am thankful to the women that spoke out 23before me and gave me the courage to publicly share 24myname today.  I am no longer ashamed of speaking 2580out, I am proud to.  1It is disgraceful that it has taken this 2long for these girls and young women to have a voice 3and for that voice to be taken seriously.  It sickens 4meto know that over 20 years ago this abuse, my 5abuse, could have been avoided.  However, no one took 6the accusations seriously, or worse yet, no one 7cared.  8Due to the shameful negligence and 9indifference of Michigan State University and USA 10Gymnastics, myself and 150 plus girls and young women 11were sexually assaulted and abused by Larry Nassar.  12Although being a part of this case and publicly 13speaking my truth are actions I'm very proud of, my 14life would have been much easier if Larry Nassar was 15never a part of it.  If he was charged and convicted 16two decades ago it would have saved myself, the other 17victims, and all of our families and loved ones from 18immense amounts of pain and suffering that will now 19carry with us the rest of our lives.  20To the pain and lifelong impact the 21defendant has imposed on myself, my family, my loved 22ones, and so many others, I feel that Larry Nassar 23should receive the maximum sentence.  Thank you 24THE COURT\", \"  Thank you.  You said a very 2581powerful statement, which is victims have a voice, 1and they certainly do, and you have found your voice.  2It is strong, loud, meaningful, and I thank you for 3being here.  4I also think it's really important that you 5recognize that this abuse was not your fault, it's 6solely his doing, and I am hopeful that other victims 7hearing you can also learn to feel and understand 8that.  I know it's a long road of recovery but your 9voice is so endearing, so important and meaningful to 10all victims who haven't spoken and those who have, 11because you are a survivor, you are a tower of 12strength, you are an example, a role model, a 13heroine.  14Thank you for being here.15MS.

MOORE', '  Daniel Moore, 23D-a-n-i-e-l-l-e, Moore, M-o-o-r-e. 24THE COURT', '  Thank you.  What would you like 258223 of 57 sheetsPage 83 to 86 of 21702/13/2018 09', '13', '26 AMme to know?  1MS. D. MOORE', \"  Your Honor, Mr. Nassar 2sexually abused me over a number of years beginning 3when I was a young teenager.  He broke me.  He stole 4my innocence and exploited it for his own sick 5satisfaction.  6All aspects of my young life was torn 7apart.  I struggled in silence, shame, and confusion 8attempting to put the pieces of my life back 9together, but I will never be whole again.  The pain 10of the abuse continues to make me feel broken, 11insecure, fearful, and overall worthless.  At times 12these feelings become completely overwhelming that I 13engage in self destructive behavior and thought about 14killing myself. 15Feeling worthless is an extremely 16difficulty emotion to describe.  I would like you to 17imagine a time you turned off all the lights in a 18room and it was pitch black for a few moments before 19your eyes adjusted.  Feeling worthless is like that 20pitch blackness but your eyes never adjust.  You are 21just stuck in the darkness, a dark and empty space, 22and the more you search for any kind of light, the 23deeper you go into the desolate, apathetic, and 24fearful trap the darkness created.  You blame 2583yourself for not being able to pull yourself out of 1the darkness and, therefore, feeling -- a feeling of 2worthlessness increases.  3For other individuals their eyes would 4adjust or they would eventually find a light.  This 5is not the case for me since this pitch blackness is 6in my mind and the darkness has grown and entailed 7itself in every facet of my life.  I have tried to 8fight back against this darkness to feel worthwhile 9and worthy.  10From others' perspectives I may seem like 11hardened and accomplished.  I have achieved so much.  12In 2009 I graduated from undergrad.  2011 I graduated 13with my first master's degree, and 2014 with my 14second master's degree.  Then in 2016 I graduated 15with my doctorate, but I never once felt worthy of my 16accomplishments.  I never walked during commencement 17because I'm not worthy of the praise, 18congratulations, and pageantry of such a ceremony.  19I have previously engaged in self harming 20behaviors.  I have stayed in abusive relationships 21when I knew deep down that I should run long before I 22did run.  I have had good relationships that never 23lasted since I did not feel worthy of the honest and 24true love that was offered.  I was stuck in the pitch 2584blackness even though the other person was trying so 1hard to turn on the lights.  2The physical damage has also been 3monstrous.  In just the last four and a half years I 4have had three major back surgeries and too -- too 5many steroid injections and nerve ablations to count.  6These real medical procedures were in the same area 7of my back that Mr. Nassar was supposed to be 8treating.  9Because of Mr. Nassar's complete lack of 10empathy and caring for my physical well-being, I 11still feel unworthy of a pain-free life or at least a 12life with minimal pain.  13What I have described is just a brief 14overview of my life.  To give you more context, Your 15Honor, the past year and few months have been the 16most difficult and trying time of my life as the 17sexual abuse resurfaced with even more intensity, and 18I have constantly relived the abuse.  Because of this 19I had to resign from my job as I fell deeper into 20depression and no longer wanted to live.  I was 21diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and 22still suffer from nightmares, intrusive thoughts, 23anxiety, depression, hypervigilance, and much more.  24I spent 30 days in a trauma treatment center as my 2585symptoms could not be controlled with outpatient 1counseling.  After I received the treatment I 2desperately needed I had to move and restart my 3career and whole life from scratch.  4The stress of constantly reliving the years 5have impacted my physical health.  I have stomach 6problems where I can barely eat anything on some 7days.  I have been hospitalized multiple times for 8back and chest pain and I developed a heart 9arrhythmia that has to be surgically corrected.  Even 10though I'm doing much better, I still have days where 11I call my mom crying, have difficulty socializing, 12and lack motivation to do anything.  13Your Honor, may I now address the 14defendant?  15THE COURT\", '  You may.16MS. D. MOORE', \"  Mr. Nassar, I feel worthless 17because of what you did to me.  You abused your 18power, authority, and stature to prey on myself and 19others who were young, already in pain, helpless, and 20without a voice.  21I want you to be remorseful, apologetic, 22and truly understand all the pain that you have 23caused and still cause.  However, I don't believe 24that you are capable of this kind of empathy.  But I 258602/13/2018 09\", '13', '26 AMPage 87 to 90 of 21724 of 57 sheetsam sure that you do feel sorry for yourself.  So I 1hope that your self pity is as dark and more 2terrifying than my feeling of worthlessness.  3Lastly, Mr. Nassar, you are no longer 4called a doctor.  You have been stripped of your 5medical license and soon you will be known by your 6prison number for what I hope to be the maximum 7sentence.  I find this fitting as I was a thing, 8inhuman, or just a number to you.  While your name 9and former title fade, I hope being reduced to a 10number will define you as it has defined me for so 11many years.  However, I pride myself on 12characteristics that you do not possess; caring, 13empathetic, and continually earning the respect of my 14patients, which is why I will no longer be known as a 15number and I will be known as Doctor Danielle Moore.  16THE COURT', \"  Ma'am, I want you to know that 17you are a name to me.

SIEBERT', \"  The first part of my 11statement is directed to Larry Nassar.  12I often find myself wondering what you are 13thinking over all of these years, doing this to all 14of these people.  Did you somehow convince yourself 15that we didn't -- that you weren't hurting people?  16That it wasn't something tangible to you?  That you 17weren't seeing the damage, or did you very well know 18that you were hurting people and did not care?  19I heard you say in your previous sentencing 20that you equated your choices to something like 21alcoholism.  But alcohol is a thing and it does not 22have to consent.  Most of us were very young and at a 23very vulnerable time in our lives.  We did not choose 24to participate in what you did to us under the guise 259025 of 57 sheetsPage 91 to 94 of 21702/13/2018 09\", '13', \"26 AMof something else.  1The people you did this to are not weak 2people.  They were and still are determined, proven 3mentally strong, and ambitious.  Each one of us had a 4full life ahead of us and we are full of potential 5and possibilities.  6This is one of the things that I find 7unique about this situation.  You were considered the 8best, and as a result of that, everyone that saw you 9had the utmost potential.  They came from loving, 10supporting families that were doing everything in 11their power to support them.  These kids had dreams, 12the means to achieve them, and were fighting tooth 13and nail to reach them.  They were the cream of the 14crop.  What you did altered critical parts of our 15growth into being healthy adults.  What you did has 16made us second-guess our own inner voice, our gut 17reactions, and our ability to have accurate 18perceptions of people.  19You put massive obstacles in between us and 20greater happiness in our lives, having healthy 21romantic relationships, and having trust for others 22who truly want to -- truly want to help us.  You 23hindered the trajectories of our lives that we and 24our parents worked so very hard for and changed the 2591rest of our lives in ways that we're still realizing 1and dealing with every day.  2This is what makes this crime so heinous, 3the cost is so high and the damage is complicated and 4impossible to measure.  5You did this to countless human beings over 6decades.  Most of our victims probably aren't aware 7of everything you did and what you're being held 8accountable for today.  Not many people look up their 9doctors they saw 20 years ago or 15 or 10 or five 10years ago.  I only found out because of a fluke.  I 11often wondered what the number of victims really is.  12The number of people whose lives you 13altered does not stop with the victims.  It has also 14impacted the people closest to us in our lives.  We 15have no choice but to watch them suffer from this 16too.  Our mothers and fathers who wanted the best for 17us, our spouses and partners, our friends, all of us 18with so many people, for what?  19More recently the price that the bravest of 20us had to have paid to get this out in the open.  21They've had to publicly attach you and what you did 22to them to their names.  Every time someone Googles 23them, possibly for the rest of our lives, they will 24see the sickening things we're talking about here 2592today; when they apply for a job, when they go on a 1first date.  They won't be able to be the ones to 2fully make the choice on when to talk to their kids 3about what happened to them.  This terrible part of 4their past is exposed to all.  In spite of this, they 5have spent so much time and energy to get to this day 6and prevent this from happening to others.  The 7strength of character that these people have shown is 8in stark contrast to who you've shown yourself to be.  9To each and every person who has worked to 10get to this day, I sincerely thank you from the 11bottom of my heart.  I also thank everyone who has 12played a supportive role which really does make a 13world of difference.  14I know our fight isn't over.  We're working 15to change the policies that allowed this behavior to 16span decades.  This type of crime is not new and the 17lack of policy to prevent it is inexcusable.  It is 18simply negligence.  If people -- if policy to prevent 19this was in place and was followed, it would have 20prevented this from happening to the majority of us.  21Whistleblowers need to be taken seriously.  Reporting 22needs to be mandatory and documented, and this part 23is not difficult to figure out.  Policymakers have 24the power to prevent this.  They need to know this.  2593I hope that you give Larry Nassar the 1maximum sentencing.  In my mind, this is what the 2maximum number of years was designed for.

You manipulated me into believing 4that everything you did was okay, that I was supposed 5to trust you, and I was supposed to never question 6anything you did because you were a doctor.  And 7because you were my doctor, you took advantage of me.  8You stripped me of my dignity, my youth, and my 9trust, all for your personal satisfaction.  10Because of your actions my life has forever 11changed.  I have to live with the fact that I was a 12victim of sexual assault.  I was a victim of sexual 13assault by someone I trusted and by someone who was 14supposed to help me achieve my passions in life, but 15instead you physically and emotionally abused me.  I 16have to live with the consequences every single day 17for the rest of my life while you never once thought 18about how your actions would affect the innocent 19women you decided to take advantage of for your 20personal pleasure.  21My childhood has forever been scarred while 22it should have been the happiest of times.  I have 23lost all trust in medical professionals because of 24your actions.  I have lost my dignity as a young 25100woman, and I have lost trust in many relationships 1throughout my life because of something that happened 2when I was only 14 years old.  3You have darkened one of my greatest 4passions in life, gymnastics, and it will forever be 5tied to your name.  Your name that will forever be 6remembered as a gymnastics doctor that abused and 7sexually assaulted me as a young woman.  8As my life goes on and your life ends in 9prison, I hope that you will realize that your 10actions have not only affected my life but also all 11of the other brave women who have came forward.

That gave me the courage to 2face the fact that I was abused by Larry Nassar at 3the Michigan State University Sports Medicine Clinic 4for many years as I came to him for medical help for 5my gymnastics injuries. 6I decided I wanted to have the courage to 7step forward and fully have this experience today so 8that I could heal and gain freedom and have closure 9from this confusing chapter of my life.  So, first of 10all, I want to thank you for having the foresight and 11the compassion to make this happen for all of us 12today.  13THE COURT', \"  You're welcome.  It's so very 14important that you're here and that your voice be 15heard and it is part of the healing, and I recognize 16that in all cases I allow victims to speak and allow 17the time needed.  You are healing.  You being in this 18courtroom, being able to face the demons, it's so 19important, and I just thank you so much for having 20the strength and courage to be here.  21What else would you like me to know?  22VICTIM 55\", \"  For those of you here listening 23today, I am remaining anonymous because that gives me 24the peace of mind that I need right now, but as I 25104stand here before you, Larry Nassar, I know that I am 1not anonymous to you.  You once knew me so well.  You 2knew my voice, my face, my body in ways that you 3should have never been allowed to know.  You knew 4everything about me.  5Up until just a few years ago you were a 6confidant.  You were my close friend who always had 7my best interests in mind, whether it is about my 8injuries, my eating habits, my gymnastics practices, 9school choices, college decisions, career path, and 10all the way up to my family plans.  I know now that 11this is one of the surefire signs of a friendly 12sexual predator.  I know now that the word grooming 13is a bad word, a word that I should never had to 14research as an adult woman.  15When I was young I did not recognize that 16the grooming you were up to for more than a decade 17with me was to manipulate me to allow yourself 18further access to my body, to take advantage of me 19for your own selfish pleasure.  Even though I tried 20to stop you many times, you continually established 21trust with me so you could continue to hurt me.  I 22had no idea that you took my love for gymnastics and 23my desire to stay out of pain and you used it against 24me.  25105I sometimes think if I can tell my younger 1self how much I was loved and valued when I was only 214 and when it all began while receiving treatment 3from Larry Nassar, then maybe I would have never been 4tricked into a friendship and support from a doctor 5that I thought really cared about my well-being with 6all of his heart.  But that is not the case here 7because it wouldn't have mattered in what state of 8confidence I ever was because he was a master at 9manipulating the situation to feed his selfish 10addiction of taking advantage of me any time he 11could.  12I completely trusted him 150 percent.  I 13never questioned why he always asked the nurses or 14residents to leave the room even though he was known 15as a teaching doctor and it would have made much more 16sense for them to stay in the room to learn his 17techniques.  But those techniques were a facade to 18feed his addiction, and because of that, I have dealt 19with questioning every person that I have ever met.  20I questioned that they had true intentions, and I 21never learned to really trust the actual trustworthy 22people in my life.  23I am not confused any longer about his 24intentions.  I now understand that he had a lifetime 2510629 of 57 sheetsPage 107 to 110 of 21702/13/2018 09\", '13', '26 AMcareer of hurting that he disguised as wanting to 1genuinely help.  I might believe that he could have 2had an ounce of good to his soul because I knew him 3so well, but he let his sinful and selfish desires 4take over his soul and his whole existence and he 5fell into the trap of extreme selfishness, not just 6for the hundreds of instances he took advantage of me 7but for so many other gymnasts, women, and girls.  8Although his actions have affected my whole 9life and especially my health and my confidence, I am 10choosing to move forward and choosing to use the 11awful pain of this to grow stronger as a woman and 12daughter of God.  13First Peter 5', \"10 says, And after you have 14suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who 15has called you to his internal glory in Christ, he 16himself will restore, confirm, strengthen, and 17establish you.  18I did, however, deal with a sense of guilt 19only due to the fact that I previously thought that 20if I would have spoken up more or louder then 21somebody would have listened at Michigan State 22University.  But I did tell a coach while on my 23gymnastics team at MSU and Kathie chose to put 24Larry's name, her identity, and the university's 25107reputation above the choice to protect me.  My 1concerns and fears were minimized by those in 2authority positions at MSU, but now I don't have to 3carry that guilt any longer.  I was child.  I did my 4best, and I did speak up.  Even if I said it louder 5or more often, it wouldn't have mattered because we 6can see now that many girls and women spoke to people 7in authority at MSU and they were not heard.  8This is so devastating.  This is a 9miscarriage of justice.  May we all learn from this 10that if a child ever comes to us about any type of 11unusual feeling coming from any adult, we will never 12brush them off.  We will listen to their every word 13and we will show them that we care and that we want 14to help them by taking immediate action for them.  15May our state, our community, and especially our 16university learn from this horrible sequence of 17mistakes that children should be protected always and 18at all costs.  19We have to find the positive.  Larry 20Nassar's actions and MSU's negligence will be the 21reason for a change in a society filled with secrets 22and confusion.  Because of the brave women and girls 23and friends and parents and family members that are 24here today that have stepped forward to bring truth 25108and light to this dark secret, we will now see a 1change.  We will know how to recognize a person of 2extreme status and high caliber can also be one that 3causes extreme hurt and trauma and is utterly 4dangerous with repercussions that last a lifetime.  5I believe the real tragedy here is not just 6that one man was extremely sinful in nature but that 7MSU did not have the proper checks and balances in 8place.  They somehow managed to glorify a criminal 9and ignore the signs.  Instead of private 10investigations, myself and several other girls were 11told by the MSU staff that we were wrong.  We grew up 12watching MSU promote and glorify a child pedophile.  13MSU enabled, paid, and promoted him to live out these 14terrible acts.  We were repeatedly shut down with our 15attempts of stopping this man.  16As I am now a mother, I can say that there 17is absolutely no excuse for this.  Regardless of how 18insignificant a child's plea for help may have seemed 19by MSU, I don't understand how this history could 20have went on for more than two decades.  These are 21the answers that I demand.  This is the change that 22needs to happen right here in our community so that 23growth will happen at other institutions.  If all of 24us survivors' pain and suffering prevents and 25109protects other children, then it will not be wasted.  1I have freedom not to be afraid anymore.  I 2will be free from the chains of control from a man 3that will never have access to me or any girl ever 4again.  And I am free from worrying what will happen 5to Larry Nassar.  His actions have caught up to him 6and God will deal with him now for what he sees best.  7I believe he needs the maximum sentence for 8his actions and so that future predators will 9remember this story and choose to stop violating 10children and get help.  The truth is out and we can 11use this truth to overcome evil and make sure these 12things will never happen again.  13For all of those that covered for him, 14enabled him, or turned the other way while I saw him 15at Michigan State University, I hope your actions 16will come to light and you can come out with the 17truth to make our university and community a safer 18place for children and women.  And if you choose not 19to, I know at some point your actions, too, will 20catch up with you.  Our God is a just God and he will 21bring mercy and healing to all of us that need it.  22With God there's always hope.  23Revelations 21, four through five says, he 24will wipe away every tear from their eyes.  There 2511002/13/2018 09\", '13', '26 AMPage 111 to 114 of 21730 of 57 sheetswill be no more death or mourning or crying or pain 1for the old order of this thing has passed away.  He 2who is seated on the thrown said, I am making 3everything new.  Then he said, write this down for 4these words are trustworthy and true.  5THE COURT', \"  Thank you very much.  Your 6voice and that voice of explaining grooming, so 7important.  Young women are listening all over the 8world and you're opening up their vocabulary and 9awareness and, of course, that's why you're here and 10chose to speak, and I really appreciate that, because 11that is not just part of your healing but protection 12of others.  You will be stronger every single day as 13defendant gets weaker, and you can rest assured 14knowing that, and I think your message is especially 15important because if I take your words together, what 16I hear is that you are asking that people, especially 17children, come before sports and that the people, 18especially the children, are not a backseat in sports 19but a front seat consideration before anything else, 20and it shouldn't be just in sports but in all life, 21but, of course, we know here defendant was a sports 22doctor -- I don't want to use the term, I know it 23upsets everyone, he's no longer a doctor but at that 24point.  And this cry that you made for checking on 25111safety is very important.  To put a system in place, 1to ensure protection against any abuse, sexual or 2otherwise from wherever it comes from, there needs to 3be a check, and you're right, from every physician, 4coach, trainer, the janitor, it doesn't really 5matter, and I think your voice is so very, very 6thought out and well meaning, because it looks not 7just at healing but at resolution, so thank you for 8being here and for speaking out.9VICTIM 55\", \"  You're welcome.

She was -- she was my 2pediatrician at the time.  From an injury sustained 3at my birthday party. 4THE COURT', \"  I'm sorry.  The court reporter 5didn't get a couple words you blurred together.

CORMIER', \"  I was taken to him for an 10injury I sustained at my birthday party and continued 11to see him for two years of what I believe was 12continued injury.  He assaulted and molested me many 13times, all of which with my mother present in the 14room.  15When I say assaulted, I want to be clear, I 16mean that he digitally penetrated my vagina and also 17molested my breasts on multiple occasions all the 18while blocking my mother from view and spouting 19something medical that we wouldn't question.  The 20first time I remember thinking it was a mistake, why 21would he ever need to do that.  At 15 I never had any 22idea.  The recurring times I was just confused and 23assumed it was necessary since he did it with my 24mother in the room, and I just never fully 25113understood.  It wasn't until last year when coming 1home for the holidays and reading the IndyStar 2article that I fully realized what happened.3Through the entire time I was seeing him I 4was told by multiple people in his office and my 5pediatrician's office that he was the best and he 6would be my best shot of not being in pain anymore so 7I assumed from there that anything that happened was 8medically necessary.  9Prior to this time I was a tenaciously 10confident, adventurous, and free-spirited girl who 11thrived in leadership roles on my soccer, cross 12country team, and in choirs and musicals.  I was 13endlessly spending time in my room writing songs.  I 14was overly loving, overly trusting, naive, seeing the 15best in every living thing type of person.  I was 16confident in my abilities and opinions and had big 17plans for my future.  18THE COURT\", '  Can you just slow down a little 19bit?  20MS.

CORMIER\", '  Okay. 2THE COURT', '  And your husband is right 3there.  You can come a little closer.  Maybe that 4would help her.  Go ahead.5MS. CORMIER', \"  Unlike most of the women in 6this room who were and are accomplished gymnasts, 7when I was a teenager I was an elite vocalist and I 8would spend most of my time in different choirs, 9ensembles, and musicals, solo competitions, and 10eventually being recruited to sing for Michigan 11State.  One of the biggest things I believe to change 12during this time is I began to become afraid of my 13own ability to write and to perform.  I believe that 14through the confusion and self disgust I felt for 15repeatedly -- from what repeatedly happened to me I 16slowly lost the certainty I had in my ability and my 17passion for being on stage and for writing music.  I 18could no longer handle the vulnerability it took to 19perform on a regular basis.  20By the time I turned 19 the only performing 21I did was bar singing in which I could use alcohol as 22a sedative for my nerves, and I haven't been able to 23finish writing a song since I was 18.  24In addition to taking some of my love of 25115music it is because of Larry and his misuse of trust 1that I stopped playing soccer.  Soccer was always my 2favorite sport and the sport I was most talented in.  3When I began seeing Larry in 2003 he sent 4me to get a bone scan in which he told me it came 5back showing a stress fracture in my lower spine.  I 6was to wear a back brace for much of that year.  He 7used my stress fracture as the reason to tell me I 8needed to continue seeing him, stop playing soccer, 9and that my back was too fragile, and with the right 10slide tackle I would end up paralyzed.  I put full 11trust in him, as you generally would a doctor who was 12told was the best, and stopped playing soccer.  13When getting my medical results for this 14legal process I found the statement no fracture is 15seen in multiple place from other doctors in my 16medical file.  It is incredibly angering to realize 17the sport that I love beyond words was taken from me 18for a reason that I now believe was completely false 19and only used to keep me as a patient for his 20personal gain.  21In addition to not playing soccer 22throughout the last 14 years due to false 23information, I also lived my life more cautiously 24believing that my body was more fragile than it was.  25116Another one of the things that I feel Larry 1has taken from me is my sense of self confidence and 2assurance in my own ability, judgment, and physical 3strength.  I worked hard to accomplish many things 4throughout my life but I've since struggled to be 5proud or share what I accomplished with others.  Not 6only does this hurt me on a personal level but has 7been an issue looking for employment.  I often cower 8to the ideas of male co-workers, especially 9supervisors, or avoid being put in a position where I 10would have to work in close proximity with men, 11sometimes even leaving positions when I feel like it 12is too much.  13Instead of taking opportunities to work 14late, when I often know it would just be me and male 15co-workers in the building, I leave immediately, 16often to the effect of being behind in my work so 17that I am never alone.  This has gotten exponentially 18worse over the last year after reliving everything 19through an adult's eyes.  20For the last 14 years I have struggled with 21trust and intimacy with others.  Generally it takes 22me a long time to fully trust anyone and possibly 23years before I really share anything truly emotional 24and vulnerable about myself, which I used to do 25117regularly and took a lot of pride as an artist to do 1so.  2Physical touch has since been a huge 3problem for me.  I get anxiety before large family 4events and holidays knowing that I will most likely 5be touched and hugged by those I love.  Something 6that should be joyful and relaxing is often anything 7but.  When touched unexpectedly even by those closest 8to me like my husband, my initial reaction is 9defensive and it takes a while for my nervous system 10to calm down.  11In addition to the anxiety being brought on 12by touch, I often feel a lot of guilt and self 13loathing for being so guarded and unloving to those 14closest to me.  In the last year since the news broke 15I had to come to terms with a lot of what exactly 16happened to me 14 years ago, and I lost a lot of 17trust in those around me.  Aside from close friends, 18I've had a year of avoiding conversation, touch, 19sharing what is going on in my life.  I often find 20myself replaying horrible flashbacks in my head 21trying to make sense of it all.  It has caused a lot 22of anxiety, depression, recurrent nightmares, and a 23lack on my personal relationships.  24One of the major issues that has occurred 2511802/13/2018 09\", '13', \"26 AMPage 119 to 122 of 21732 of 57 sheetsrecently is that I have -- I have always had anxiety 1when being around male doctors but it has gotten 2exponentially worse, and as someone who has gone 3through infertility testing and currently pregnant, 4it becomes exhausting to have to constantly advocate 5to have a female doctor and explain why it's 6necessary when somebody doesn't take you seriously.  7If I'm unable to see a female physician, I generally 8have intense anxiety leading up to and during the 9exam.  For example, a couple months ago I had gone in 10for an HSG test and was only able to get a male 11doctor.  They allowed me to have two young techs with 12me at the time, but I had so much anxiety having a 13gynecological procedure done by a male, between that 14and the pain, I passed out on the table almost 15immediately after it started.  My heart rate and 16blood pressure were so low the office had to call my 17husband to come get me.  It is ridiculously 18embarrassing to have to take extreme precaution for 19my medical care.  I generally thrive in high stress 20situations and intentionally work in such, but when 21it comes to my own medical care, the simplest issue 22is paralyzing.  23It has also made the process of making a 24birth plan with my hospital unnecessarily very 25119complicated and I fear what the added anxiety from 1this case and what I live with day-to-day will do to 2my daughter.  3I have also lost a lot of the love I had 4for coming back to my hometown and the passion I 5always held for being a Spartan.  Coming back to East 6Lansing has always been a fun and exciting time for 7me.  I see friends and everything.  And even though 8we live out of state, it was important for my husband 9and I to come back to campus and be married there, 10but it has now turned into reliving what happened to 11me years before the entire time.  I no longer look 12forward to spending my weekends watching sports with 13friends, which has always been a large pastime of 14mine and has been a hobby since I was young 15Overall this trauma has caused me a great 16deal of depression, anxiety, recurrent nightmares, 17intimacy issues, loss of enjoyment in loved 18activities, issues at work, feelings of guilt, shame, 19low self esteem and self worth, and occasional 20suicidal thoughts.  It has caused feelings of guilt 21and depression in my family members, especially my 22mother who knows this has to do with the pain that 23she was in the room at the time, and added 24unnecessary strain on my closest relationships.  25120These things that happened to me in his 1office long ago were not short-lived, uncomfortable 2moments.  They were lifelong traumas that has changed 3the way I walk in the world.  4And if it's okay with you, I'd like to say 5something to Larry.  6THE COURT\", '  You may.7MS. CORMIER', \"  To Larry.  In reference to 8something you said during your plea hearing, which I 9know other girls have referred to today, although I 10understand that you have the right to give a 11statement in defense of yourself, please know that I 12do not buy for one second what you said.  To me, it 13sounded like the same manipulative narrative that 14puts you in sympathetic light that has allowed you to 15remain in a powerful position for far too long.  I 16don't believe you have changed or truly grasp the 17pain you've caused any of us.  18Also, I as a Catholic, like you, believe in 19forgiveness, but you will be getting none from me at 20this time.  A year of saying the rosary does not 21erase all the evil you have done in my eyes and I 22hope in the state's as well.  This is between you and 23God.  24While you remain on this earth I hope that 25121you are continually reminded of the pain you caused 1all of us as we are constantly reminded in our daily 2interactions of our lives.  We did not get to choose 3this trauma, but you did.  4My hope is that the women here like myself 5do continue to grow and heal and become stronger than 6ever before, but that will be because of our actions 7and our strength, not yours.  I hope to take that 8strength to continue to work with vulnerable 9populations and have something come out of my pain 10so, Your Honor, I ask that you impose the full 125 11year sentence.  I do not believe he should get to 12terrorize the hundred plus girls and get to walk away 13with anything less than a year for each of us.  He 14should have to truly come to terms with the amount of 15pain he caused the vulnerable children and women that 16trusted him. 17THE COURT\", \"  It seems to me after this you 18can finish writing.

As for the details of 20myencounter with Nassar, unfortunately those are 21more difficult to forget.  22A little history about me.  Though legally 23an adult at 18, I was still very much a kid when I 24came to Michigan State.  I left school, one, having 25125kissed two boys and, two, armed with my dad's 1permission to punch anybody in the nose who tried to 2put his hands where he shouldn't.  3Going in as a freshman I was pretty naive.  4I was desperate to compete and I wanted to get 5better.  I was considered a star player coming out of 6high school and expectations were high for me when I 7first entered the program.  So when my performance 8was not up to par -- I sat on the bench first half of 9the season -- I felt like I was letting my team down 10so I worked harder, practiced more.  Just like 11everyone in this room, you want to get on the floor 12and compete.  13The rigors of training began to take a toll 14on my body and I battled shoulder inflammation along 15with back and leg injuries.  I was highly motivated 16to heal and I wanted nothing more than to compete to 17mypotential for the benefit of my team.  Sports 18medicine was new to me so who was I to question it?  19Growing up in my family you went to the doctor if, 20one, you were dying, two, you broke a bone, or, 21three, you were due for a checkup.  Other than my 22high school athletic trainer who occasionally iced 23and taped up my ankle, my experience with sports 24medicine doctors was obsolete at best.  We treated 2512602/13/2018 09\", '13', \"26 AMPage 127 to 130 of 21734 of 57 sheetsour sprained ankles, jammed fingers, and pulled 1muscles at home.  Coming under the care of sports 2medicine doctors was a new experience for me.  I was 3absolutely blown away by the program and how well 4they took care of their student athletes.  5So here are the details of the incident as 6I remember them.  7To the MSU volleyball team Doctor Nassar 8was jokingly referred to as the crouch doc for his 9unconventional methods of treating back and hip pain.  10The buzz around Jenison Fieldhouse is that he was 11somewhat of a wizard, a nationally recognized doctor 12with great success in his field of expertise.  It 13seemed like the doctors at MSU were always in demand, 14especially Doctor Brumm and Doctor Nassar, so when I 15was squeezed in to see the doctor with the miracle 16treatments, I was very grateful.  Again, this was 17back when Jenison had medical trailers for a brief 18time because our training room didn't have adequate 19private space for doctors visits.  I remember having 20the option of keeping my Spandex on, which I was very 21grateful for and chose.  He had me lay down face down 22on the medical table.  When he started treatment I 23remember him saying his treatment relied upon 24applying pressure to areas around the pelvis and that 25127this was normal, so when he went down there I just 1told myself it was normal, that he knows what he's 2doing, and don't be a baby.  3I remember he first started with 4pressure -- excuse me.  Excuse me.  He first started 5with pressure points around the outside of my vagina 6and around my pubic bones.  He said he was trying to 7relieve pressure and something about nerve endings in 8that area being related to the back.  He would just 9ask me questions and talk about life, his work, and 10how he used this method to help some.  However, 11during the procedure I am now choosing to report, he 12just gradually moved in, pressing through and 13stretching my Spandex with his fingers as he entered 14through my vaginal opening.  I remember laying there 15wondering, is this okay?  This doesn't seem right.  16Should I say something?  What's happening?  I didn't 17know what to do.  He just kept on talking about life 18like when you go to the dentist and they talk about 19random stuff to try to make you feel at ease.  He 20didn't say anything out of the ordinary, he just did 21it as though he was doing something as mindless as 22riding a bicycle.  23There are two arguments at war in my mind, 24this doesn't seem right versus he's a world-renowned 25128doctor and he's treated so many athletes.  Everyone 1knows he treats down there and they don't complain so 2just stop being a baby.  Everyone trusted him.  I 3told myself I needed to trust him, too, so I 4convinced myself it was just a normal part of the 5procedure and kept my mouth shut.  However, I could 6not have prepared myself for what happened next.  7Originally I was very hesitant to share the 8details of this part.  I did not want to give Nassar 9or any other sexual predator the opportunity to 10relive any details but I think this is a huge problem 11in society today that there are people that are 12hesitant to speak up because they think a victim 13wanted to be assaulted.  And that's just not true.  14So in my opinion this is the worst part15Again, growing up in a culture with little 16experience of my own, I assumed something like what 17happened to me would only happen if I wanted it to.  18Now that I'm a grown woman with friends in the 19medical field, I know this is not true at all from a 20medical standpoint, but what I knew at the time was 21based on magazines, movies, culture, and other teens 22just joking about it.  To be clear, during that 23appointment Nassar put direct pressure on places I 24didn't know existed at the time and my body reacted.  25129I didn't want it to but it reacted anyways, and as it 1was happening I remember laying there frozen stiff on 2the table utterly mortified, confused, and scared.  I 3felt so powerless to control what was happening.  My 4mind was willing one thing, for it to stop, and my 5body was doing another thing, not stopping.  And all 6the time I had no idea whether or not he was aware of 7what was happening.  He just kept on with his 8treatment as if nothing had happened.  9I didn't move until the treatment was over 10and then I tried my best to pretend nothing happened 11and left as quickly as I could.  12The initial aftermath.  In the aftermath 13questions raced through my mind a mile a minute 14trying to make sense of it all.  What just happened?  15Trying to desperately understand why I couldn't 16control what was happening to my body.  Could my body 17really react that way if I didn't want it to?  I 18thought that was impossible, but clearly it wasn't 19because it just happened.  If it's not supposed to 20happen like that, what does that say about me?  Was I 21sick or something?  Did I need help?  I felt like my 22body had just betrayed me, and I had built up such a 23wall of protection in my mind around Nassar that my 24first reaction was to question myself, to blame 2513035 of 57 sheetsPage 131 to 134 of 21702/13/2018 09\", '13', \"26 AMmyself.  I wanted to believe the best in people, but 1no matter how much I rationalized, he's a doctor, 2he's trying to help you, you should be grateful he's 3treating you, he didn't mean for it to happen, I 4couldn't shake the voice in my head that said 5something wasn't right.  6But how could I tell someone?  I was so 7afraid if I told someone the truth that they would 8think I was lying, that they would think I was one of 9those athletes just looking to stir up trouble.  I 10was scared they would draw their own conclusions, 11they would believe the only way for my body to react 12in that manner was if I liked it, if I welcomed it, 13or if I wanted it.  I knew -- I was afraid that 14people would look at me differently.  I was fearful 15of being looked down upon, of being labeled.  I was 16fearful a man wouldn't want me after that.  That no 17man would want me.  People would think I was messed 18up.  I would be deemed unlovable, unacceptable, and 19what if what Doctor Nassar did was unintentional?  20What if my body was just abnormal?  Again, I was 21young, inexperienced, and I didn't know there was a 22spot inside your body that triggered that type of 23response.  I feared the possibility of accusing an 24innocent man, that I could ruin a good doctor's 25131reputation and career for performing a normal medical 1procedure.  He couldn't control how my body reacted, 2or could he?  3Could what happen be some abnormal freakish 4side effect or something?  But what if it wasn't?  It 5was all so confusing, but in the end I decided to go 6to my trainer, Lianna, or Lili as we affectionately 7called her, and ask if there was a way for athletes 8to file a general complaint just stating that they 9were uncomfortable with their doctor's visit.  Again, 10all I wanted to do was say I'm uncomfortable and to 11have that heard and recorded with the small hope that 12I wasn't alone.  13So when I came to her asking her if I could 14file a general complaint, she treated the situation 15with both seriousness and sober-mindedness and tried 16to walk me through the process the best way that she 17knew how.  She asked me all sorts of questions, did 18Nassar do something you thought was criminally wrong?  19Did he hurt you?  I remember trying to answer as 20truthfully as possible, but I was so scared of 21revealing what I thought were shameful details that I 22didn't give her much to go on.  23In the end, she wanted to make sure I 24correctly understood what filing a report would 25132involve; an investigation, making an accusation 1against Nassar, and stating that I felt that he did 2something unprofessional or criminally wrong.  At the 3time I couldn't say I -- could I say that with 4certainty?  I had a hard time saying that with 5certainty.  I just wanted to say I was uncomfortable 6and have it recorded.  I wasn't aware of a way to do 7that without making a formal accusation and exposing 8those mortifying details to the world, so instead of 9filing a report, I came up with a plan for the 10future.  If I ever had to be treated by the doctor 11again, I would be forthright and clear.  If he tried 12to go there, I would speak up.  I would say I was 13uncomfortable, and I resolved in my mind if he 14proceeded to cross a boundary after that, I would 15drop kick him in the face.  Armed with this initial 16resolution, it just felt safer to move on.  17I'm sorry, I'm breaking from this for a 18minute.  19And then you come in here and you see all 20these beautiful, young women, these little girls -- 21I'll get to that later.  Just stick with it.  Go.  22Okay.  23So why am I now choosing to report this?  I 24didn't hear about the accusations against Doctor 25133Nassar until the day after my birthday, which was 1April 7th of 2000 -- what was last year?  2MR. BEDFORD\", \"  '17.  3MS. BEDFORD\", '  Thank you.  When I first 4heard about it my initial instinct was to send a 5group chat to my teammates.  I knew some had been 6treated by him, and I wanted to make sure no one was 7as oblivious as I was.  It sparked a conversation and 8I found myself once again faced with a decision to 9speak up.  Memories began to resurface and I found 10myself having to revisit the scenario once more again 11under different circumstances.  12With a sexual experience of a woman married 13nearly 12 years and armed with the realization far 14more athletes had similar experiences to my own, I 15now find it very hard to believe that Doctor Nassar, 16as a recognized medical professional, did not know 17those spots were there and that he was unaware of the 18changes that were happening to me when I was lying 19face down on that medical table, so I called my 20church mentor, a physical therapist at Botsford 21Hospital in Metro Detroit, and through uncontrollable 22sobbing I began to painfully unearth and recollect 23the incident I had so decidedly buried years ago.  24She was the first person I ever told.  Even 2513402/13/2018 09', '13', \"26 AMPage 135 to 138 of 21736 of 57 sheetsarmed with the knowledge I was not alone, I could 1barely muster enough courage to share the details of 2myencounter with Nassar.  3Gradually over the period of a few days I 4faced my fear, opened up to select friends, family, 5and my team about the incident.  The love and support 6I received from them has been overwhelming, 7especially from my husband who's been an 8un-formidable rock of protection, love, and 9understanding through this process.  If I were to put 10someone else in my shoes, I feel like I could easily 11understand her situation, her emotions, and 12reluctance to speak up, but it's a little bit more 13difficult when you're the one in those shoes.  14The past few weeks -- so this is when I 15initially made my report in May, so during that time 16period and since it's been a roller coaster of 17emotions.  I constantly ask myself, did I have the 18power to stop him?  Did I have the power?  Could my 19voice have been the one that broke the chain of abuse 20and stopped him in his tracks?  Even now speaking the 21truth is, admittedly, difficult.  It's vulnerable.  22It's risky.  People might still arrive at their own 23misguided conclusions, and I'm powerless to stop it.  24However, I'm convinced it's the right thing to do.  25135Even though my case may be 101 out of a 1hundred similar cases, I want to stand with all women 2who came forward before me and after me if just to 3say you're not alone.  And speaking up for my loved 4ones, my nieces, my nephews, my family, brothers, 5sisters, friends, I pray they would never find 6themselves in similar circumstances, but should that 7day come, I want them to be courageous, truthful, and 8to speak up without shame.  I am speaking simply to 9stand for truth and to face fear and to refuse to 10give fear a foothold any longer.  11Since I gave my initial statement to Doctor 12Munford -- Doctor Munford -- detective -- got you.13DETECTIVE MUNFORD\", '  Thank you.14MS. BEDFORD', \"  Getting all of this on paper 15and preparing for this has been no small feat.  The 16amount of energy and emotional toll required to 17process and digest all of it has been completely 18draining.  I agonized for hours whether or not to 19speak in person, processing the potential 20repercussions and how my actions and decisions to 21speak up would affect loved ones around me, the 22opinions people have of me.  I wish I could say this 23was it, that this crime would no longer affect me or 24myloved ones, that I could forgive once, find 25136closure, and simply move on, I just want it to be 1over, but, unfortunately, it's not that easy.  2The truth is that once the gavel comes down 3and the sentence is revealed, for me the battle is 4not over.  Memories remain and a sense of uneasiness 5and uncertainty has been created from the choice to 6come forward, to stand, and to be counted.  How does 7one gain victory over memories?  You can battle 8memories but you can't erase them.  We try to keep 9them at arm's length, stop, locked someplace outside 10the boundary of our daily lives.  However, despite 11all our effort to squelch, bury, and forget, those 12memories remain and they find a way to invade at the 13most inopportune times.  They have no scruples, no 14manners, or decorum.  All it takes is one trigger to 15unlock the door and those memories rush in like a 16flood.  Sometimes during even our most private and 17intimate moments they rush in unwelcomed with the 18ability to make us feel just as ashamed, just as 19embarrassed, small, and powerless as we felt when the 20incident first happened.  21While I have hope to find peace and gain 22quicker victory over the emotions that accompany 23those memories, fighting to remain at a place of 24peace will be a battle I fight for the rest of my 25137life.  Memories like that try to accuse you at every 1opportunity.  2During this season of life, this is my 3reality.  By making a decision to speak I must not 4only face the memories of those events but unearth, 5revisit, and reassess all the details I so decidedly 6buried years ago.  There were things I didn't 7understand and things I made excuses for, because, 8quite frankly, I was afraid.  And processing it all 9has been both painful, damaging, liberating, and 10terrifying all at once.  11For the longest time my story was hidden.  12No one could hurt or judge because no one knew.  Now 13it feels -- well, not feels, everyone knows.  Try to 14imagine yourself stripped naked, exposed to the world 15standing in a room filled with people examining you, 16judging you.  I kept my secret away for years because 17of fear.  I imagined the worst thing that could 18happen and the risk felt too great.  19I'm still convinced my decision to stand 20for truth, to silence shame, and to be counted is the 21right thing to do, but I didn't anticipate -- what I 22didn't anticipate was that this resolve to stand for 23truth would be challenged in my own mind every single 24time I chose to share my story.  Entrusting the truth 2513837 of 57 sheetsPage 139 to 142 of 21702/13/2018 09\", '13', \"26 AMto others, it's not without risk.  You hear it over 1and over.  It's a safe place.  Safe?  You want to 2believe that.  But no matter which way you slice it, 3you're still standing there naked in the middle of a 4room vulnerable revealing some painful details to 5people, people who have both the power to heal and 6hurt, restore and ostracize, support and reject, or 7bully and blame, and you're powerless to control 8their reactions.  Simply observe children out on a 9playground and you'll learn very quickly human beings 10do not need a reason to be unkind.  11So if history dictates that a storm might 12be coming and that people could be both unkind 13towards you and towards the loved ones that stand up 14for you, you brace for impact, and this is the 15tumultuous aftermath.  It is paranoia and the fear of 16not being accepted.  It's dealing with the swirling, 17raging, chaotic storm of thoughts and fears that 18accompany one's choice to be vulnerable and being 19forced to face the uncertainty that comes from an 20unavoidable reality.  What was hidden is no longer 21hidden, and because of that, circumstances in your 22life could be different than they were before.  23I didn't anticipate that I would 24second-guess myself, that I would second-guess my 25139relationships, and even the thoughts of those closest 1to me.  I found -- it's not difficult to imagine what 2people are thinking.  Granted, saying, hey, I know 3what you must think before people have had a chance 4to express their opinion isn't exactly fair, but it's 5not difficult for my train of thought to go down that 6track.  7As a result of what's happened with Doctor 8Nassar I need to fight harder to trust those close to 9me and equally hard to make insignificant the 10opinions of those that would come against the truth 11of who I am.  12And that's a whole separate level, my own 13thoughts towards myself.  You're faced with the 14realization that you could have said something and 15didn't because you were afraid, ignorant athletes.  16We're supposed to be brave.  We're supposed to be 17strong.  But you were a coward.  Your dad is a police 18officer, you should have known better.  You made the 19wrong choice.  You see, it's not that difficult for 20our own hearts to condemn us either.  I have battled 21guilt of not speaking up.  I questioned my ability to 22make sound decisions, and I needed to face the truth 23that, yes, I was scared.  But I was recently reminded 24by a friend of a passage I love in my bible.  It's 1 25140John, 3\", \"18 through 20, that says, Little children, 1let us not love in word and speech but in action and 2truth and by this we will know that we belong to the 3truth and will assure our hearts in his presence.  4Even if our hearts condemn us, God is greater than 5our hearts.  He knows all things.  6So my conclusion, I'm still searching for 7healing, for wholeness.  I know it's there for me but 8at this point in time I can't see it fully, but I'm 9battling for it.  Every person who has come forward 10must find their own way to stand under the weight of 11it all.  As an athlete, I was trained to battle, to 12be a warrior, to fight and overcome, so for me in my 13mind I find myself engaged in an all-out war against 14any accusation that might come against the truth of 15who I know myself to be.  16As a Christian I have every reason to hope, 17yet right now I'm fighting to believe that.  When my 18heart condemns on every side, when that train of 19thought starts barreling down the tracks a hundred 20miles an hour with no sign of stopping, what's left 21to me is to step out in front of that train, root, 22ground myself in the truth of who I am, and stand 23firm in that foundation and push back.  24I am loveable.  I am wanted.  I am 25141significant.  I am accepted.  I am valuable.  I was 1made to love God and love people without fear.  2Depression is not my portion but joy and hope are my 3portion.  4The road to healing looks steep from where 5I am standing now, but I am a warrior.  There are 6unformidable truths that God says about me that no 7man can steal or spoil, so I arm myself with these 8truths.  They're a sword in my arsenal and I know the 9end of the story for me.  I will win, but I'm 10still -- right now I'm still in the fight.  11As for the sentencing, I feel I can trust 12the judgment and decision of the court after hearing 13all of these testimonies that have come before you.  14May I address Doctor Nassar, please?  15THE COURT\", '  You may.

Thank you for your 15words.  I thought they were powerful, and a couple 16things I loved about what you said is that you said 17some positive things about yourself, and that's 18really helpful to the other survivors.  19You are courageous.  You are truthful, and 20you recognize, especially as an athlete -- we found 21now gymnastics, soccer, this is now extended into 22volley ball, and as athletes you all know the saying 23no pain, no gain.  This case certainly sheds a whole 24new light on that saying, in my mind.  25143You all have to go through the fire of this 1pain, but there will be tremendous gain, not just for 2you but for countless others who are in the same 3situation or who may be in the same situation in the 4future.  5What you've expressed, your thinking, how 6you were thinking that you didn't really voice it 7because you were so young will remind young people to 8ask those questions, is this okay, this doesn't feel 9right, why doesn't it feel right, let me talk to 10someone, to have that voice beyond inside of their 11head to ask an adult who hopefully is a different 12trusted adult, because those questions are important 13and those voices should come out and there should be 14somebody always available to listen.15And you talked about blame.  Blame is an 16epidemic in these cases that has to stop, and your 17words can help stop the blame, because victims should 18never, ever be blamed, and it's that fear that 19stopped you from asking those questions, and all of 20you who are coming forward hopefully have that fear 21along with others, ask those all important questions, 22and maybe teachers to talk to students, parents to 23talk to their children about if it doesn't feel 24right.  25144We've all read those articles but many 1people don't voice it, and you have voiced it here 2today.

I wondered how this might affect my 15future, my career, the loved ones in my life.  I took 16a step back and realized that, once again, I was 17letting the fear, the shame, and the guilt own me.  18I decided it was time to stand up to Larry 19Nassar and to those that enabled him to continue down 20this ravaging path of sexual abuse.  Today I am here 21for me and to be an advocate for the women and young 22girls whose voices have been silenced for so many 23years.  24I remember the first time Larry Nassar 2514639 of 57 sheetsPage 147 to 150 of 21702/13/2018 09', '13', \"26 AMsexually assaulted me.  It is not something easily 1forgotten, the intense sense of terror, anxiety, and 2disbelief came washing over me.  I lay there in pain 3unable to speak, staring blankly at the wall, 4desperately searching for a way to escape.  5I kept repeating in my head, this is a 6mistake, this isn't real.  I thought, he's a famous 7doctor, there's no way he would do something 8inappropriate in front of my mom.  Well, I was wrong.  9He used his power and position in society to earn our 10trust so that he could use us for his own sexual 11pleasure and gratification.  12These, quote, treatments happened over and 13over again, eating away at my innocence as a child.  14I was just a young girl with big dreams.  Aspiring to 15be the best figure skater I could be.  This is what I 16received in return for my dedication to the sport.  A 17sport that I loved so much, tarnished with vile 18memories.  I'm not sure I could even ever look at 19figure skating the same again, which is a shame 20because the sport essentially defined who I was as a 21child.  22I have always struggled with intimacy in 23relationships because of what Larry Nassar did to me.  24I have vivid flashbacks of him assaulting me.  25147Sometimes I can't even tolerate another person 1touching me in an intimate situation without feeling 2physical pain and experiencing these visual 3flashbacks.  I'm in the room again, on that table, 4reliving these events to this day.  5I feel disgusting.  I find it hard to trust 6not only those I have been in intimate relationships 7with, but also those in positions of power.  I wonder 8who might betray me next?  Because if he could pull 9this off, then who's to stop anyone else from hurting 10me, too.  11I have poor self-esteem and I experience 12frequent episodes of anxiety and depression.  When I 13see someone that looks or sounds like him, my heart 14races, just like it does before I have one of my 15beloved panic attacks.  Sometimes I feel a sense of 16guilt because somehow I wonder if it was my fault 17that all of this happened?  18Relationships with my family members have 19suffered especially since all of this has become 20public.  The nightmares about what he's done have 21haunted me night after night.  22As I sat down to write a statement, I asked 23myself, how can I put this horrific experience into 24words?  There are no words for this.  25148Despite these unfortunate events, I wanted 1to be clear that I will continue to overcome this.  I 2will grow as a person.  I will succeed in my career, 3and my family will flourish because his facade has 4been broken.  I am in charge now.  5It has been hard accepting what Larry 6Nassar did to me.  I'm angry and I'm sad, but I will 7not be silenced anymore.  I encourage the court to 8enforce a minimum sentence of 40 years up to the 9maximum allowable sentence in prison.  It is 10imperative to show our society that sexual abuse will 11not be tolerated, and that we value the importance of 12bringing proper justice to those who have suffered by 13the actions of others.  14But we cannot stop here.  Those who have 15enabled Larry Nassar in his general and high 16lifestyle need to answer to us as well.  Michigan 17State University must take accountability for their 18absence in putting an end to this abuse scandal.  19MSU recently stated that no one affiliated 20with their university, quote, believed that Nassar 21sexually abused anyone until the news articles in 222016.  Well, there's a difference between not 23believing and something seeming unbelievable.  Either 24way, they had the knowledge of the abuse, and their 25149duty was to report it and take action.  If this had 1been appropriately addressed, I wouldn't be here 2talking to you today.  3Something has gone severely wrong at MSU.  4They have ignored us and their lack of action shows 5us that they stand behind a serial sexual abuser.  I 6had higher expectations for my alma mater.  7Until then, we will do our best to heal, 8but I'm afraid for the safety of future students and 9athletes if MSU does not take ownership in their part 10to this story.  11I hope today shed some light into the 12darkness that I have lived through, and I hope to 13give hope to those who have been through the same.  I 14am strong, and together we are even stronger.  Thank 15you.  16THE COURT\", \"  Thank you.  Ma'am, I appreciate 17your words, and you do appear to be very strong 18despite you acknowledging that you're still healing, 19and you'll be healing for a very long time, there's 20no question, but your words are a sign that you are 21healing, that you're taking your power back, that 22you're giving him back his kryptonite.

ERICKSON', \"  Thank you, Your Honor, for 22allowing me to speak today.  23My name is Ashley Erickson.  I am a former 24gymnast and competitive cheerleader.  I was a patient 25152of Doctor Nassar from 1999 through August of 2016.  1Today I can say that I am finally ready to 2face you.  Rather than someone that I used to trust, 3I am looking at a monster that took advantage of me.  4I have a question for you.  Why?  Why did 5you feel that you could do this to us, and not only 6get away with it, but you also felt that you were 7allowed to?  You were the adult.  You were the 8doctor.  9You were also someone that many people told 10me could fix my medical problems.  Instead, you 11groomed us into believing that you cared about us, 12but really you were just fixing your sick thoughts 13and fantasies.  14I remember even lying to you at times 15saying I wasn't in too much pain just because I 16didn't want you to do the procedure.  I didn't know 17why I was asking this or lying to you.  I just knew 18something wasn't right.  You were truly sick.  19I am coming forward so you can no longer 20hurt anyone else and take things away that you took 21away from me.  22Ever since I realized what you were 23actually doing to me, it has been hell.  I have put 24my family and friends through hell.  I've also lost 25153jobs because of how much you have affected me and put 1me through.  I have to rethink everything.  I have no 2trust left for anyone because you took that away.  3How do I ever trust meeting new people after learning 4that someone I trusted for years has betrayed me and 5also took advantage of me?  So why on earth would I 6ever trust anyone again?  7I try every day to overcome this, but every 8day is still a struggle.  More importantly, though, 9it's what this has done to my family.  We have to 10work on our relationships every day because now I 11tend to be so distant and push them away.  I would 12have never done this before.  But now I have, 13unfortunately, became really good at it because I 14still don't want to face what you have done to me and 15how much it affects me daily, so therefore it's just 16easier to be by myself.  17I truly hope with all of us coming forward 18and finally saying what we need to say to you makes 19you realize what you have done.  I hope you think 20about it every day just like I do.  I want this all 21to go away.  I want the nightmares of you coming into 22my room to go away.  I want to be able to go out in 23public without seeing someone that looks like you and 24get so afraid that I have to suddenly leave.  I want 2515441 of 57 sheetsPage 155 to 158 of 21702/13/2018 09\", '13', '26 AMto rebuild relationships so I can finally trust 1someone again in my life.  I want to be independent 2again, find a job, and not be afraid to go to that 3job by myself because of panic attacks.  I want to be 4the same Ashley to my family that they once knew.  5I want to be able to get help again for my 6medical issues without the fear of other doctors 7being just like you.  I truly just want to live again 8without the fear of you in my life.  9Finally, Larry, I will no longer let you 10define who I am or who I will be.  I will be strong 11again.  Thank you.  12THE COURT', \"  Thank you.  Ma'am, I think 13every single victim here and in every similar case I 14have ever had has asked why.  It's really the 15unanswerable question.  This defendant is ill.  He's 16never probably going to understand or acknowledge 17exactly what he did and the ramifications, the 18vastness of the destruction that he caused each of 19you.  The only thing I can do is to do what you've 20all asked me to do and to sentence him accordingly, 21which I will do.  22The monster who took advantage of you is 23going to wither much like the scene in the Wizard of 24Oz where the water gets poured on the witch and the 25155witch withers away.  That's what's going to happen to 1him, because as you get stronger, as you overcome, 2because you will, he gets weaker and he will wither 3away.  4Prison is no place for a human being to 5live.  Rehabilitation here is not in the cards.  6Either is the answer you seek as to why.  Don't beat 7yourself up about why.  Understand he's very ill, and 8nothing is your fault.  But what you can do is stand 9as you are in this court, tall, proud with your 10brothers, as a family and say, no more, on behalf of 11yourself, other victims, and I think you've done that 12today.

I was a 14gymnast, competitive gymnast, and really dedicated to 15the sport.  I spent a lot of time in the gym, had a 16lot of injuries.  This one year -- this one month in 17'97 we were at a competition and I ended up 18fracturing and dislocating my coccyx bone, my 19tailbone, and went over to see him the following day, 20and I had seen him before for, like, some wrist-type 21injuries, things like that.  And I went over to the 22table, and my mother was in the room, and he 23explained that due to the injury, which he had an 24x-ray, he did show us the coccyx bone was dislocated 25157and fractured --1THE COURT\", '  How old were you at the time?  2MS.

So she was in the room.  5He explained, I'm going to need to have you take off 6your pants and lay face down and I will have to 7massage the muscles with my fingers, and he said, I 8will have to go up anally and massage those muscles 9to loosen them before I move the bone back in place, 10so I laid down, and my mother was aware, and he 11instead inserted his fingers into my vagina, and 12because of me being 12, I didn't know -- I really 13didn't even know the difference, honestly, if it was 14my vagina or what.  I didn't know.  But I just 15remember being in so much pain, tears streaming down 16my face, holding on to the table just shaking, and I 17felt like I didn't -- I didn't know what to do.  18My mother and him were having a 19conversation this whole time just about whatever, 20life, and it seemed like forever, went on forever, 21and finally he pulled his hand out anally and then 22inserted them vaginally, and that's when I knew there 23was a difference at that point and that he had his 24fingers in both places. 2515802/13/2018 09\", '13', '26 AMPage 159 to 162 of 21742 of 57 sheetsTHE COURT', \"  Was this -- if you don't mind, 1and you don't have to answer, was this with gloves or 2without gloves?

I 7went back to see him a couple weeks later, feeling 8better, and he says -- we didn't do an x-ray, didn't 9do any x-ray -- he said, it's out of place, again I 10need to redo the procedure, and I remember just being 11completely scared.  You know, I didn't want to go 12through that again.  I did not want to go through 13that.  But I went through it again, and the same 14thing, the tears coming down, almost kind of, just in 15the middle of it, I don't want to say blacked out but 16was, like, out of body almost, just numb, blank stare 17kind of, didn't know what to do.  My mom was, once 18again, in the room.  19And on the way home I told her what 20happened and she was livid.  She was so furious.  I 21remember her saying, what?  He did what?  He didn't 22tell me he was going to do that.  He just said he 23needed to anally massage the muscles.  He didn't tell 24me he was going to go up the other way, and at that 25159point I was scared.  I didn't know what to think.  1Being a 12 year old you kind of just trust the 2doctor.  Like, you know, all the other women were 3saying, you just believe that he's doing what's best 4for you, what's right for you.  Being that young, 5just trust, and he was very well respected and 6everybody talked so highly of him, so back in the gym 7I remember people whispering about what had happened 8because at that point it went around to everyone.  9All the parents were talking, coaches were talking 10about it, and I felt really alone, just -- I didn't 11know what to think or do, really.  Just very alone.  12THE COURT\", '  Do you mean that they were 13talking about what happened to you?  14MS.

The 18coaches, I think that was -- I know they're probably 19listening and watching -- the people that I was most 20disappointed in because they were supposed to protect 21us and they just decided that it was more important 22to have functioning athletes and the reputation was 23more important than our well-being and how we felt, 24so, you know, really that was the thing that really 25160broke my heart was that they let -- they let me down, 1and I want to say this, because I think in all sports 2now, especially with this happening, I think it's 3important that coaches really try to be there for the 4athletes and not think about the sport and the 5competition and that notoriety of how great they are 6over the fact that they're working with children, 7they're coaching children, they're leaving their 8children in care of somebody like Larry and they're 9just brushing it all aside, and I don't want that to 10ever happen to anybody else.  11So, you know, this happened when I was 12.  12I'm now 33.  And I have four kids of my own, and I've 13had so much depression over my life, over the years, 14I think that was my biggest struggle, severe 15depression.  I've been having trouble sleeping, 16trouble with relationships, trouble keeping jobs.  I 17mean, everybody's story that I listened to, it's just 18an echo of everything that I have went through.  19They're just speaking like it's my voice, so I 20just -- it's just really surreal, actually, being in 21this situation right now.  Never imagined I would be 22here.  I heard about this last minute and I really 23couldn't sit down and write.  I said, I just have to 24go up there and say what happened and speak my truth, 25161so I'm trying to think if there's anything else that 1I need to pinpoint right now.  2I just want other girls to be safe -- other 3people, not just girls, other athletes, even boys to 4be safe from sexual predators from this kind of 5abuse, and, oh, I do forgive you, too, Larry.  I 6believe in forgiveness.  I'm not going to carry that 7for the rest of my life.  I'm not.  I have important 8things to do as a mom.  I have some really great 9people in my life.  My dad is here to support me 10today.

Thank you very much.  20VICTIM 125\", '  Good afternoon, Your Honor. 21THE COURT', \"  That's very good.  But you 22don't have to lean in so much.  23VICTIM 125\", \"  Thank you kindly for the 24opportunity to address this court.  25164Like all of the brave women who have stood 1before you today, I juggle many roles in life.  I am 2many things.  I am a mother of a beautiful two year 3old daughter.  I have been an attorney for over a 4decade.  I am someone's partner, someone's sister, 5someone's friend, someone's neighbor.  And I am a 6survivor of childhood sexual abuse of the man who 7sits before me today, Larry Nassar.  8Larry, it has been many, many moons since 9our paths last crossed.  I stand here today as what I 10understand to be one of the earliest reported cases 11of sexual abuse at your hands.  I think it is 12important to what I want to say to you today to start 13from the beginning.  14Something I never realized about you is 15that your relationship with the sport of gymnastics, 16and thus little girls in leotards, started in your 17high school years when you worked as an athletic 18trainer starting in 1981 for which you somehow earned 19a varsity letter in women's gymnastics, thanks to 20your work with the team.  21Seven years later in 1988 your relationship 22with the sport of gymnastics and little girls in 23leotards would continue.  This time in the greater 24Lansing area at Great Lakes Gymnastics Club.  25165You were three years out of college.  I was 1eight years old.  As our volunteer athletic trainer 2at Great Lakes you practically lived in the gym.  You 3were there almost every single day for hours with 4your big black medical bag full of supplies over your 5shoulder.  You arrived to the gym early to tape our 6ankles and shin splints and stayed late to tend to 7the rips on our hands and our pulled muscles.  I 8general -- it genuinely seemed as if you had a 9tireless passion for your work, for the sport, and, 10in turn, for us.  11You were not yet the famous Olympic doctor.  12You were not a doctor at all.  You hadn't started 13medical school at Michigan State University.  You 14weren't married to Steph.  I hadn't been a guest at 15your wedding nor danced at your reception yet.  You 16were not a father to three children, two of them 17little girls.  So who were you back then?  You were a 18young man with his whole future ahead of him, a 19future that seemed to be full of nothing but promise 20and passion.  You were the man who was loved and 21trusted by dozens and dozens of us little girls and 22our families.  23You quickly became a fixture at the gym, 24everyone's favorite.  You were the good cop to coach 2516602/13/2018 09\", '13', \"26 AMPage 167 to 170 of 21744 of 57 sheetsJohn Geddert's bad cop.  When he broke us mentally 1and physically, depriving us of water on a hot 2summer's day in the un-air conditioned gym or pushing 3us to practice on broken bones, you were the one who 4stepped in.  You defended us.  You stood up to him on 5our behaves.  You protected our bodies from further 6pain.  You literally and metaphorically put us back 7together.  8It seemed as if we were a little family 9back then.  In hindsight, a readily dysfunctional one 10all in a sense growing up together.  You, John, 11Kathie Klages, and that first generation of gymnasts 12known as the originals.  13We were all armed with nothing but dreams.  14John dreamed of getting a girl to the Olympics at any 15cost.  You dreamed of becoming a sports medicine 16doctor.  And I with mediocre gymnastics ability 17dreamed of going away to college, getting married, 18having a family.  And I also dreamed of becoming a 19sports medicine doctor because that was your dream 20and I wanted to be just like you.  21Those early years in the gym were brutal, 22as I know you must remember.  John was young and 23pushed all boundaries.  He was boss.  The enforcer.  24The screamer.  The thrower.  The perfectionist.  The 25167one from whom we desperately sought approval or even 1just some small sign that he actually cared for us 2and not just for winning3You, Larry, were the gentle one, the 4nurturer who always had a smile, a hug, a kind word.  5You earned our trust.  You earned my trust.  But, 6more importantly, as I was just a little girl, you 7earned my mother's trust.  You treated us like 8family.  You attended each of my doctors' 9appointments.  You sat with my mother during my 10surgeries.  We were guests at your wedding.  And yet 11at some point you began pushing boundaries in your 12own terribly, terribly troubled way.  13None of us will ever, ever, ever know when 14or where you started abusing children.  Was that 15always your plan when you found yourself attracted to 16the sport of gymnastics as early as high school?  Had 17you abused anyone before then?  Was the good guy 18persona just an act?  Were you building our trust for 19a reason?  So that you could perpetrate and penetrate 20later on?  And, most importantly, who was that first 21girl?  Am I her?  Do you even remember?  Do you even 22remember what we will never forget?  Can you even 23remember, Larry, when it all began?  24Was there any traceable, albeit faint, 25168voice of conscious within you back then saying, don't 1do it?  Do you remember how you justified it to 2yourself that first time?  I am sure I will never 3know the answers to my questions, but what I do know 4is that I laid alone naked in your apartment in 1992, 5me, 12 years old, you 28 years old, while you 6massaged my tiny body, touching my clitoris and 7penetrating my formerly un-penetrated self.  8By this time you were in medical school at 9the Michigan State University College of Osteopathic 10Medicine.  You had called my home and asked me to 11come to your apartment where you once lived -- where 12you lived alone because you were conducting a study 13on flexibility on behalf of the medical college and 14you needed subjects for the study.  My mother was out 15of town but granted permission for me to go to your 16house because not only did she love and trust you, 17but because I was supposed to be one of several 18subjects participating in your Michigan State study.  19I got a ride to your apartment from my neighbor, and, 20predictably, there were no other subjects there.  You 21instructed me to disrobe and take a bath in your tub 22in order to heat my muscles and relax which would 23aide in your measuring of my flexibility.  24After my bath you rewarded me for my 25169generous participation in your study by having me lay 1naked on the treatment table in the living room of 2your sparse one bedroom apartment as you massaged the 3entirety of my 12 year old body, suggesting that I 4relax as you slipped your adult fingers in and out 5and in and out of my body.  6That was one of the many, many times that 7your hands were in me, on me over the next many 8years.  You became a doctor, started treating more 9patients, and we all know how the rest of this story 10unfolds.  11Now here we sit, Larry, exactly 30 years 12since our paths first crossed.  Next year I will be 1340 years old.  And you, you're spending the rest of 14your life in prison.  What you have to live with at 15this point as a purported Catholic man is not my 16problem and, quite frankly, I really do not care, but 17what I have to live with?  I may be the oldest victim 18survivor here this week.  Had I not been sucked into 19your pretend care and pretend love, had I not trusted 20you, had I actually understood that having my vagina 21and anus penetrated by a grown man that I loved and 22trusted when I was 12, 13, 14, and beyond was not 23okay and that was not your love or your care for me 24or your duty as my athletic trainer or Michigan State 2517045 of 57 sheetsPage 171 to 174 of 21702/13/2018 09\", '13', \"26 AMmedical school student or Michigan State doctor or 1Olympic doctor, then I could have spared every girl 2who came after me and the suffering that only someone 3who has experienced this will understand.  4You chose to take from me, from all of us, 5something that was simply not yours to take; a 6shaken, if not irreparable, sense of self, a grave 7inability to trust, to open ourselves up to love, to 8sleep, to work, and some days to breathe.  What you 9took was sick and psychotic and disturbed and bottom 10line a robbery.  Had I been able to identify the wolf 11in sheep's clothing of a sexual predator under the 12guise of a loving friend and medical professional and 13eventual employee of the trusted Michigan State 14University, none of the other girls would be standing 15here before you this week having to face you, their 16robber.  17So what you need to hear from me today is 18this.  When a grown man penetrates the vagina and/or 19the anus of a small girl or does anything at all to 20compromise her sense of trust or safety, the course 21of her life is changed forever.  In that moment when 22you had each and every girl who is here this week on 23your table, not to mention the hundreds and 24thousands, potentially, of girls who are not here or 25171have not yet come forward, in that split second when 1you made the choice to put that finger inside of our 2little tiny bodies for the first time, not for 3medical treatment but for your own pleasure, you 4changed the entire course of our lives.  One moment, 5one finger, you took something from us that we will 6never, ever get back.  Our innocence.  Our 7childhoods.  And, in a sense, our virginities.  Those 8were not yours to take.  9And yet in that moment when you took each 10of us -- from each of us for the first time, the 11course of your life did not change -- well, not 12immediately anyway.  You ate dinner.  You brushed 13your teeth.  And you went to sleep.  You were 14rewarded with prestigious roles.  You got to travel 15the world.  You were entrusted with the job of caring 16for the United State's most talented gymnasts.  You 17went to the Olympics, not once, many times, before 18John and then with John.  19How each victim survivor has and will 20continue to navigate this life-altering catalytic 21experience that you chose for us will run the entire 22spectrum.  Some will never trust, never engage in 23functional relationships, sexual or otherwise, and 24some will never give birth because the very thought 25172of having to see a physician who will have to touch 1them in personal places paralyzes them.  2Some will suffer from anxiety and sleepless 3nights for the rest of their lives.  Some will never 4overcome the depression that results from having been 5a victim of your sexual abuse.  6Others will become activists, warriors for 7this cause.  They will dedicate their lives to 8ensuring that people like you are not enabled and in 9a sense indirectly permitted to do as much damage as 10you were enabled to do by the likes of Michigan State 11University, USA Gymnastics, and Twistars.  12And me, Larry?  I want you to know that 13while you spend the rest of your life behind bars, my 14life has been and will be okay.  I am a survivor of 15stage four disease.  I live with two autoimmune 16diseases, and I haven't slept soundly since 1992.  I 17could spend another hour depicting how I personally, 18medically, and psychologically have suffered at your 19hands, but, quite frankly, I don't care to.  All you 20need to know about me, Larry, is that I'm free, I am 21successful, I am a mother, and I am happy.  Not 22because you were one of the most, if not the most, 23formative males in my entire life but in spite of you 24and in spite of that fact.  I am okay.  25173What I know for sure, Larry, is this, your 1legacy will not be that of a healer, of a great 2Olympic, Michigan State doctor, of a respectable man, 3of a good father, or husband, or son.  Unfortunately, 4your legacy is that you are quite possibly the 5greatest perpetrator of sexual abuse of all time.  6That, my former friend and loved one, is yours to 7live with.  8None of us in this room, Larry, is your 9final judge.  You may attempt to do good while you 10are in prison, removed from society for the rest of 11your life, and knowing you, you will and you will 12try, but what you've done, what you've taken, and how 13boldly and shamelessly you've taken it for decade 14after decade after decade, I can only wonder what 15might become of your soul.  16I pray for Steph and your children because 17the Lord knows they need it now and they will always 18need it.  And I pray for the hundreds of women you 19abused who have not come forward, each for their own 20heavy reasons.  21And as for you, Larry, the rest of your 22life you will be a prisoner, but what should we call 23you?  A predator?  A criminal?  A molester?  A 24psychopath?  A pornographer?  An abuser?  A thief of 2517402/13/2018 09\", '13', \"26 AMPage 175 to 178 of 21746 of 57 sheetsinnocence?  They all seem so inadequate because they 1are.  And so you will be given a number.2In Dante's epic poem, The Divine Comedy, he 3wrote about his journey through the nine circles of 4hell.  His tour guide was Virgil.  When they arrived 5at the ninth circle of hell, Dante' found himself 6within a large frozen lake.  Trapped in the ice, 7according to his guilt, were those guilty of 8treachery against those with whom they had special 9relationships.  Treachery.  What is it?  It's a 10betrayal of trust.  Deceptive action.  Disloyalty.  11Duplicity.  Think about those nine words again for a 12moment.  Treachery against those with whom they had 13special relationships.  14I had a special relationship with you, 15Larry, as did every little girl you violated.  We 16were entrusted to your care.  We entrusted ourselves 17to you.  Our parents entrusted us to you.  This 18community full of wonderful, honest, hard working 19people entrusted the daughters of Lansing and beyond 20to you, and in return you gave us treachery and now 21your punishment awaits you.  Thank you.  22THE COURT\", \"  That was outstanding.  I have 23to say, you asked, do you remember what you did to 24me?  I will never forget.  Well, he will never forget 25175your words.  Your words will go in and out and in and 1out of his brain in his sleep, while he's awake and 2behind bars, so I appreciate the thoughtfulness, the 3detail, and the depth of your words.  They were very 4heartfelt and powerful, but also I know you say 5you've gotten past it, and I don't know if you'll 6ever really get past it, only you know the harm, and 7one of the things that you said troubles me in that 8being one of the earliest ones you wonder if you 9would have said something then, if it wouldn't be 10this case.  That's a heavy burden for a 12 year old, 11and at your age I know there's still a 12 year old 12girl inside of you who feels that way.  And I need 13you to let go of that.  I don't think there's any 14victim -- actually, I know there is no victim 15survivor who blames any other victim, including the 16first or the second or the third.  Because as you 17know as a lawyer, as a trained individual, so much 18goes unreported because of the pointing of blame, not 19belief of the treachery.  When you talk about it, 20people don't want to believe it.  It's not a popular 21subject.  There's no one that blames you, and you 22need to just let go of that, because you've done so 23well, and I think that's a bit of a stumbling block, 24and you are absolutely correct, your life is 25176wonderful and it will continue to be so and you are 1just this -- because you're a little bit older -- no 2offense, you're beautiful, but you're a little bit 3older than the rest of the victims, so they can look 4at you and say, I can be like her, because some of 5them are not as strong as you yet, so it's so 6important that you talk about what you did, what you 7accomplished, that you've let go of this, and the 8only thing I ask you is to let go of that 12 year old 9girl, give her permission to say it's okay, I didn't 10report it, because you know at 12 you are powerless 11really.  You don't have a voice.  There were adults 12who should have been watching and checking.  It's not 13your fault there's other victims, so let go of that, 14and thank you for being such a strong role model with 15such an epic voice.

It was something we never thought we would 11have to even think about, it was this man, Larry 12Nassar.  13He was someone we completely trusted.  He 14was our friend, our neighbor, Lindsey's friend, and 15her doctor.  Someone who was so well respected by 16everyone we never second-guessed his intentions on 17our daughter.  18Larry had been Lindsey's doctor since she 19was nine years old.  He was also Lindsey's mentor, 20her confidant, her employer, and he was also someone 21who ultimately abused her on a daily basis for many, 22many years, starting around the age of 10.  These 23photos are how little she was when he began the abuse 24on her.  25179He convinced these little girls that this 1was a medical treatment necessary to help their 2injuries.  He also told and convinced the little 3girls not to discuss this treatment with their 4parents because they would not understand.  This 5treatment continued for many years.  These children 6thought that this was the norm.  He was doing it to 7multiple gymnasts so they all thought this was what 8Larry did to make them feel better.  9These girls had no idea this wasn't a 10medical procedure.  He had always told -- we always 11told both our kids that if anyone touches you down in 12your private areas, except for a doctor, to come to 13us immediately.  She had no reason to be alarmed 14because he was her doctor, just as we told her.  He 15was also someone she completely trusted, her sound 16board after a long, hard practice.  Why would he ever 17want to harm her?  18Our family was devastated to learn of 19Larry's actions.  We did not want to believe it, but 20it hit hard and fast.  The betrayal we feel is 21sometimes very hard to grasp.  Our daughter is 22scarred forever.  Our son is scarred forever, and we 23as parents are scarred forever.  24Lindsey's dad, her brother, and I will 25180never be the same.  We trust no one.  We have many 1sleepless nights over the guilt we feel for missing 2this.  We never imagined that we would be those 3parents we all see on the news whose children were 4abused by someone, someone close to their family, and 5the parents had no idea.  This is us.  This is our 6true reality.  7The guilt we feel will never go away.  All 8the questions we think of and all the red flags we 9missed, it truly has been gut wrenching and will be 10embedded in our minds forever.  11With his lack of true remorse, this is a 12person who will repeat his crimes.  You can hear it 13in his statements to you and other judges that he 14still does not accept the damage he has done to all 15these kids, parents, his own family, and all that was 16associated with him.  17Your Honor, we ask that you give this 18monster the longest sentence available so he never 19harms again.

I had worked so hard to get there and I, 2along with my family, had sacrificed so much to get 3to that point.  My spine was badly fractured and my 4life, but more important to me, my gymnastics career 5was falling apart.  6He was the only one I was wildly assured 7who could really help me, help me further than any 8other doctor had helped me so far.  He was just so 9talented and brilliant, they said.  Indeed, he did 10seem impressive.  11He was absurdly nice and did everything he 12could to make me feel comfortable the second I met 13him.  He smiled widely each time he saw me and on the 14surface it felt like he genuinely cared for me.  It 15seemed like he was determined to help me get better 16and that gave me another level of certainty.  Most of 17all, he gave me hope.  I thought he was the most 18trustworthy doctor I ever could have imagined.  In my 19innocence I felt that I would have done anything -- 20anything to heal my fractured back and not quit the 21sport I loved and persisted through since I was two 22years old.  23Gymnasts are tough as nails.  They will 24fight.  They will bleed.  And they will persist all 25184for their dreams.  And that's exactly how I was.  1I still remember Nassar calmly and vaguely 2assuring me that his treatment regiment might be a 3little uncomfortable but that it would surely help to 4heal my pain and return me to the sport I loved.  5These were just the magic words I was looking for 6that none of the many other doctors I had previously 7seen would tell me.  Here I was a scared little girl 8in excruciating back pain, willing, begging even to 9suffer through for my sport.  This grown man 10confidently offered me salvation, healing, and 11freedom, and I trusted him, but he turned out to be a 12monster.  13I am disgusted -- disgusted that Larry 14Nassar, the trusted adult, authority figure, and 15famous doctor had the audacity to use his incredible 16power, prestige, and influence to sexually abuse me, 17a little girl, right there in his office in the 18safest and warmest of places with such an overlying 19sense of healing and recovery.  I was counting on 20him.  He broke in loudly without consent or 21restraint.  He was an unwarranted intruder to my most 22private, intimate, never before touched places 23without warning, without gloves, and without 24explanation.  25185And so again and again and again he abused 1me all the while telling me wild tales of his Olympic 2journey and his family, very confidently, suavely 3even, trying to distract me from the un-distractable.  4It certainly seemed and, unfortunately, viscerally 5and physically felt like he had done this treatment 6many times before.  This was yet another reason I 7desperately told myself to trust him.  8THE COURT\", '  How old were you?  9MS. HALICEK', '  15. 10THE COURT', '  Thank you.  11MS.

To this day that pain and these feelings are 15still there.  16Each appointment with him I desperately 17waited for it to be over, to be healed, putting every 18last drop of faith in him.  I remember being 19embarrassed each time I rose off the table because it 20was so obviously drenched with sweat.  21Then one day after his prolonged and 22consistent abuse he finally gave me my fate.  My back 23could not be healed and I had to quit my dream.  He 24had all of his visits of fun with me and then sent me 2518649 of 57 sheetsPage 187 to 190 of 21702/13/2018 09', '13', \"26 AMaway depressed, dejected, molested, and confused, now 1alone to part ways with my deepest love, gymnastics.  2My innocence was ruthlessly taken away from me never 3to return.  4This was such a dark period in my life that 5still today is difficult for me to revisit.  As I 6stand here I still flashback to the feelings of fear 7laying frozen in his office, my sweating, shaking 8body, adrenalin pumping, painfully clutching the 9sides of the table waiting for this sick treatment to 10be over.  My little child self, smarter and more 11astute than I gave her credit for, knew something was 12wrong but she was petrified to the point of physical 13and emotional paralysis as she tried so hard to keep 14trusting this man she thought was her savior, 15vigilantly ignoring how she felt and what was really 16going on.  I was so afraid to talk to anyone.  17The most confusing part was that my mother 18was in the room with us while this happened.  He 19strategically placed himself between us and 20skillfully obscured what was happening.  I felt a 21disoriented sense of safety since my mom was there, 22and, after all, he told me it was going to be 23uncomfortable.  What I didn't realize, she couldn't 24see exactly what was happening.  This sickens and 25187continues to baffle me to this day.  1Larry made me believe that this was my only 2hope.  That he was my only hope.  Besides, all the 3other adults around me told me so, and I so shut my 4eyes so tight that they hurt and I held my breath.  I 5summoned that notorious gymnastic strength and I 6marched forward.  7For years I had this atrocious secret and 8fear.  I felt so much shame and embarrassment.  I 9suffered but I told myself to be tough.  When the 10reports about him started trickling out I just knew I 11was right all this time and I wasn't alone.  12Then my world swiftly stopped.  Everything 13I had pushed away for so long came over me like a 14waterfall.  All my denial, repression, and depression 15that had been present and underlying there all along 16overcame me.  My trauma reopened anew; a fresh deep 17wound.  18While the constant news following Nassar 19this past year has been vindicating at some points, 20it has mostly been cruel and exhausting.  I relive my 21pain each and every day questioning why he did this 22to us and never finding the right answer.  23I completely dropped out of my life this 24past year as the gravity and wickedness of Nassar's 25188serial abuse has overcome me.  Months at a time I did 1not leave my bed, sometimes questioning why I was 2even alive, all while his touch continued to 3violently linger on my body as it does today.  I lost 4my wits.  I screamed.  I woke up crying.  I went to 5bed crying.  I did not, I still do not understand.  6These uncomfortable, invasive memories are 7my reality now.  The imprint of his face and abuse 8hinder my life which at times has turned into a 9nightmare.  Crippling complexes such as paranoia, 10anxiety, depression, sexual issues, and insomnia, to 11name a few, have all taken their unique and 12oppressive turn at overshadowing my life as a direct 13result of what Larry Nassar did to me.  Then and now 14his abuse has cost me.  15It is important to everyone hearing this 16that to this day I still do not feel safe.  The world 17feels unsafe.  Men feel unsafe.  I can't sleep 18without a night light.  I'm paranoid when I walk 19anywhere alone, looking around every corner 20constantly believing I'm about to be attacked.  If 21someone enters a room without announcing themselves I 22jump and border on the edge of a nervous breakdown.  23I'm intensely vigilant that someone, somewhere, 24whichever place I might be is about to take advantage 25189of, sexualize, or hurt me.  1There are oftentimes I shield myself from 2the world and pray that men don't find me appealing 3lest they target me, manipulate me, and hurt me like 4Nassar so smoothly did.  I feel disconnected from the 5world, alone, and in pain.  I couldn't trust anyone 6to keep me safe back then and I can't trust anyone to 7keep me safe today.  I have lost my ability to be 8confident with myself and others.  9To those at MSU, USAG, and the USOC who 10knew about Larry Nassar and did not act, the sin of 11omission is just as bad as the sin itself.  As if 12dealing with the intense publicity and pain around 13Nassar wasn't enough, you have added a heartless, 14depraved level of denial and victim shaming to the 15mix.  16You have said terrible things.  For 17example, that victims didn't understand the nuanced 18difference between sexual abuse and medical treatment 19and it is virtually impossible to stop a determined 20sexual predator on your campus.  This is disgusting.  21Do you know how the statements make us feel?  Do you 22understand the impacts of our words?  Do you know how 23these statements put other victims in the state of 24fear so deep that they may never come forward?  2519002/13/2018 09\", '13', \"26 AMPage 191 to 194 of 21750 of 57 sheetsYour actions are abusive in and of 1themselves.  Your attitudes of apathy and dismissal 2have made the healing process particularly difficult, 3especially because you haven't taken actions to 4produce legitimate investigations.  This means that 5every day we still have to remind ourselves it's okay 6that we came forward.  What happened to us is very, 7very real, even though we so desperately tried to 8deny it for so long.  9I recently learned that Nassar's crimes 10could have been prevented as early as 1997 when the 11first brave woman came forward.  Learning our abuse 12could have been prevented but instead flourished for 13decades is a bitter and nauseating pill to swallow.  14Adults were enamored by Nassar because they 15experienced all of the trustworthy, impressive, 16illustrious talented elements of him, minus the 17abuse.  They wanted to protect him, and now that the 18act is up, they are emotionless and indifferent, 19lackadaisically managing the issues they once 20overlooked and placing their limited information on 21evading responsibility as opposed to taking 22ownership.  Shame on you.  23I'm only now beginning the long road of 24healing.  I am so grateful for the incredible women 25191who have come forward and made it possible for me to 1be brave enough to tell my story.  I don't know where 2I would be without you.  3Thank you to my incredible loved ones who 4stood by me on my darkest and scariest days saying I 5love you and I support you.  As much as Larry 6Nassar's abuse has cost me so much of my life, I am 7determined that it won't affect me in the future.  I 8will do what it takes for as long as it takes to heal 9so that this no longer has power over me.  10I promise you that I won't stop fighting.  11In my heart I know this is my time and this is our 12time.

She has 17requested that she remain anonymous and would like 18the cameras turned off before that's being read.  And 19I will present the court with her photograph.  20THE COURT\", \"  Ma'am, cameras are off. You may 21proceed. 22MS. SNYDER\", \"  Honorable judge, I did not 23choose to have him as my doctor.  I was not star 24struck by the magazine covers with him in them framed 25193in medical exam rooms.  I didn't know who he was.  I 1was a no name high school athlete that got injured 2during practice and was sent to see him due to a 3referral.  4What he did physically to me for three 5years is nothing in comparison to what I have 6emotionally and mentally endured.  7I still have medical issues that he was 8supposed to be treating me for but failed.  I do not 9trust doctors because of how he took advantage of me 10for his own sick pleasures.  I do not trust people to 11know that this story belongs to me as he makes me 12feel dirty, disgusting, and ashamed.  13What he did to me has damaged my future as 14I do not find myself worthy of love.  I see myself as 15damaged and tainted.  Therefore, it has been hard to 16let someone else love me as I do not love myself.  17I cannot say exactly where I would be today 18if this had not happened to me.  Knowing the path 19that I was on before he abused me compared to where I 20am now is like night and day.  21Before I met Larry Nassar I was an honor 22roll student, socially active, involved in many 23groups, and volunteered.  When it came to my senior 24year, when I stopped seeing Larry Nassar, I barley 2519451 of 57 sheetsPage 195 to 198 of 21702/13/2018 09\", '13', '26 AMgraduated high school.  I lost the ambition and the 1vision I had for my future.  2This has caused me the loss of many 3relationships.  I cannot look at my mother the same.  4I called my mother after talking to an attorney and 5she expressed how relieved she was that I was doing 6something about what he did to me.  I was so 7confused.  After talking with her more about it, she 8knew what he was doing but thought it was a medical 9procedure just like everyone else.  She said that it 10made her uncomfortable and that is why she stopped 11going to my appointments.  I felt abandoned.  I lost 12faith and trust in her role as a mother.  13Since this has come out it has made me very 14hypervigilant on whether anyone knows who I am, who 15can I trust to tell, and how do I tell them something 16like this?  Also, if I do tell them, what if someone 17overhears?  Will people look at me differently?  Will 18people judge me or will they pity me because they 19feel bad?  20Larry Nassar manipulated me 21psychologically.  He made me deny how I felt when I 22was screaming inside to stop what was happening 23because he acted so calm like nothing ever happened.  24He made me trust him and not second-guess his medical 25195procedure.  1There are things in my past that I am not 2proud of.  This has made me question what all details 3to include on how this has changed me for fear of 4being judged.  I would never have to worry about 5these details if I never had to live the nightmare of 6Larry Nassar being my doctor.  7Even though I am not a famous gymnast, I 8still matter, and my story is relevant.  I hurt too.  9With all of the media attention on gymnasts and not 10what he did has taken the focus away and may deter 11girls like me to come forward and deny that something 12has happened to them as they are not a gymnast.  13Victim 48.  14THE COURT', \"  Ma'am, thank you very much.  15You weren't a gymnast?  16MS.

I was scared 5and confused about what had happened to me.  I didn't 6know how to approach anyone to tell them about what 7had happened out of embarrassment and fear.  8The memory of what Larry Nassar did haunted 9me on a daily basis.  I eventually quit gymnastics, 10never seeking another doctor to address my back pain.  11Even after my career in gymnastics was over I still 12thought about what had happened to me.  13Since all of this has come to light, the 14memory of what Larry Nassar did to me has only been 15intensified.  Not only do I think about what Larry 16did to me, but to all the other victims as well.  The 17thought of Larry Nassar remains in my daily thoughts 18and my dreams.  It is a memory that I will never 19forget.  20Nothing can change what Larry Nassar did to 21me and the other victims.

Your Honor, I 5appreciate the opportunity to address the court in 6order to tell my story and the impact that the abuse 7I suffered by Mr. Nassar has had on me. 8I was 17 when I went to see Mr. Nassar for 9help with my back pain.  At the time my father was 10terminally ill with cancer so my parents were unable 11to attend this appointment.  Mr. Nassar took 12advantage of my circumstances and of me.  13I remember him telling me that he could 14give me a massage to help with my back pain.  I 15cautiously undressed and laid down with a sheet over 16me as he instructed.  He proceeded to penetrate me 17vaginally and massage my breasts.  My body froze.  I 18was screaming inside but lay there too scared and 19confused to do anything.  20After he completed his, quote, treatment, 21he told me to get dressed while he sat there 22watching.  He then scheduled weekly visits for me.  23In a daze I left the office only to be stopped by the 24receptionist to schedule my next appointment.  I 25201informed her he had already done so to which she 1looked confused and responded, quote, he doesn't 2schedule his own appointments.  After reviewing my 3chart she was hesitant but verified that he had 4scheduled these.  5Looking back I realize that he had 6scheduled these to continue the abuse.  He had found 7a young girl in a vulnerable situation and intended 8to take full advantage of that situation.  9When I got home from school that day I told 10my mom what had happened.  She took me to the police 11station where I filed a report and went to the 12hospital to get a sexual assault kit done.  I was 13terrified of what this exam entailed.  I sat in a 14cold hospital room, my body tensed when they took the 15samples.  I remember fearing that no one would 16believe me.  Unfortunately, this fear became a 17reality.  18About a week later the police contacted my 19family and asked us to come in for a meeting with Mr. 20Nassar.  I told my parents that I did not want to 21face him so they went without me.  At this meeting 22Mr. Nassar informed my parents that this was simply a 23misunderstanding and that because I was not a 24gymnast, I was not as comfortable with my body.  2520253 of 57 sheetsPage 203 to 206 of 21702/13/2018 09\", '13', \"26 AMThere was no investigation and I was left to feel 1like the whole situation was my fault.  2I felt powerless and like there was no one 3I could trust.  I struggled with these feelings as I 4watched my dad dying right in front of me.  My 5anxiety was at an all time high.  I suffered so 6severely that at times I was unable to leave my home.  7I began medication and therapy.  To this day I still 8suffer from anxiety and continue with these 9treatments 13 years later.  10I went on with my life and successfully 11pursued my career as a physician assistant.  However, 12the memory of what happened never left me.  For 13 13years I wondered if I was the only one or if there 14were others he had done this to.  I tried to convince 15myself that I was the only one and that I had scared 16him enough by filing a police report so that he would 17never do this again.  Sadly, this was not the case.  18I remember the day I found out about the 19other allegations.  I broke down and a huge wave of 20guilt came over me.  I felt like I should have done 21more to stand up for myself and to prevent the abuse 22of the other women.  As the number of victims grew 23and the stories came out, I was horrified.  Mr. 24Nassar took away the innocence of so many young women 25203and girls.  He blamed us for, quote, misunderstanding 1what had happened.  2I will never forget what Mr. Nassar did to 3me but I do have a sense of relief knowing that no 4other young woman or child will be subjected to his 5abuse.  6I recently gave birth to my first child and 7therefore was unable to travel to Michigan for 8sentencing.  This is a joyous time in my life but the 9trauma from the past and the realization of the 10extent of his abuse has put a cloud over it.

I 21don't know if Brianne is listening or not but there 22will be a record, and what I want to say to her is 23that today with her words there is no 24misunderstanding of what happened.  I am very clear 25204that no victim has lied, that they were all 1assaulted, that the use of treatment was misused, 2mis-defined, and I suspect that there were 3appointments that were not needed, probably in 4violation of other statutes, insurance paid for this, 5so the crimes just get bigger and bigger, and I'm 6saddened that Meridian Township Police Department, 7who I know to be very efficient, very good, and we 8hear testimony all the time from them, I see the good 9work they do, I'm sorry they missed this one.  But, 10again, defendant became a good liar, and what 11happened, what I'm gathering from all these victims, 12is that because Meridian Township, because 13universities, because parents, all unsuspecting, 14seemingly, defended him, he felt untouchable so he 15continued to touch children for his own pleasure.  16I have heard what Ms. Randall has said and 17I applaud her words, and I can't imagine not being 18believed while her father is dying, so she's grieving 19the loss of her childhood and the loss of a parent.  20That is immeasurable pain, so I thank her for her 21words.  22Next.  23MS.

But the last year I've had 2to put a brave face on in front of my young children 3to protect them from their sad, confused, and 4grieving mother.  I have had to forgive my parents 5for not being more involved in my treatments as an 6injured and defeated young college athlete.  I have 7had to explain to my loving husband why intimacy had 8become difficult for me.  I will be affected by 9Doctor Nassar's abuse for the rest of my life.  10At the time of the treatment I hated his 11demeanor.  His use of too much medical jargon, his 12groping and his touching of my vaginal area inside 13and out.  I dreaded every appointment.  14I was suffering from a herniated disc, L-5 15and S-1, and had chronic nerve pain shooting down my 16legs.  I had already had one surgery and was trying 17to avoid a second more serious spinal fusion surgery 18because I knew the impact it would have on my 19collegiate athletic career and my life.  I was 20 20years old.  21All I wanted to do was to be able to 22compete in my sport again and live a pain-free, 23active lifestyle.  My athletic trainer trusted that 24Doctor Nassar would live up to his reputation.  25207Doctor Nassar was recommended to me as the 1second opinion outside the medical team at the 2University of Michigan.  His reputation, his 3authority, his accolades cloud the truth behind the 4procedures that was supposed to alleviate the nerve 5pain and to help me avoid surgery.  They didn't.  I 6had to have that spinal fusion surgery, but not 7before I endured several sessions of pure torture and 8agony.  9Each treatment was an hour.  He massaged my 10breasts, buttocks, groin, hips, and would end with 11what felt like endless digital penetration.  Doctor 12Nassar never stopped his hands.  His treatments made 13mefeel like I was an animal, a piece of meat.  I 14remember using a rough paper towel in his office 15after treatment to wipe him off of me before leaving 16the exam room.  I remember being sore inside.  17As a student athlete on scholarship at a 18Division One, Big Ten university with strength 19coaches, head coaches, assistant coaches, trainers, 20sports doctors, and physical therapists, the list 21goes on and on, our bodies were our most prized 22possession.  We trained them, worked them, and dealt 23with high levels of pain running through them.  Mind 24over matter.  Athletics were not something I did, an 25208athlete was who I was.  1Keeping my body healthy to maintain my spot 2on the field and maintain my financial scholarship 3was the most important thing in my life.  I was 20 4years old but still a child living within the bubble 5division one Big Ten college sports.  I had to trust 6my coaches, trainers, and physical therapists.  I had 7to trust my doctors.  No questions asked.  Doctor 8Nassar knew this.  Doctor Nassar preyed on my 9desperation and my weakness.10It is my opinion that Doctor Nassar should 11be held accountable for his strategic and 12manipulative abuse.  His sentence should keep him in 13prison for the rest of his life just as I was a 14victim of his abuse for the rest of mine.  15Thank you, victim two. 16THE COURT\", \"  Thank you.  As to victim two, 17I'm hopeful she does not feel manipulated and a 18victim anymore, although we use that term 19simultaneously with a survivor.  She is a survivor.  20I'm hoping now that her words are out, that she's 21publicly made this statement, that the crying will 22stop and be replaced with happiness and joy, because 23she is no longer defeated.  Defendant is defeated.  24She a pillar of strength for coming forward, for 25209recognizing what happened to her, and for joining in 1with the other victim survivors.  Together you are 2all such a strong voice, and I'm hearing this over 3and over, and maybe I'm repeating myself, I don't 4care, the more we have to hear it, as many times and 5as often as we can say it because victims -- other 6victims who need to come forward, and victim two 7needs to stop crying -- I'm hoping she stops crying.  8I'm hoping that her words are crying into the world 9and to other victims to come forward, so thank you, 10victim two.  11MS.

      "  Good morning.  My name is 1Kyle Stephens.  Up until this point I have been known 2as victim ZA or family friend.  I was the first to 3testify in this case, and weary of the attention that 4can come with that, I asked for anonymity.  5This process has been horrific, but 6surprisingly therapeutic.  I am addressing you 7publicly today as a final step and statement to 8myself that I have nothing to be ashamed of. 9I met Larry Nassar when I was somewhere 10around the age of five years old.  My parents had 11become close friends with Larry and his wife, 12Stephanie.  They were all medical professionals and 13shared a passion for the subject.  14Most Sundays Stephanie and my mother would 15cook dinner together for both families.  We shared 16sporting events, holidays, and many weekends in 17between.  18It was during this time, I estimate I was 19approximately six years old, that Larry Nassar began 20to sexually abuse me.  He first exposed his penis to 21me in a dark boiler room in the basement of his home.  22He told me, if you ever want to see it, all you have 23to do is ask.  He used his power as an adult to 24manipulate me.  254Over a six year period he progressed from 1exposure to masturbating in front of me while playing 2hide and go seek, rubbing his bare penis on my bare 3feet, and penetrating my vagina with his fingers, all 4of which took place with my parents, my sibling, his 5wife, and his children in the same house.  6Let me remind you of the interests of a six 7year old girl.  My favorite t.v. show was Clifford, 8the big red dog, and my favorite book was Junnie B. 9Jones.  I could not do a multiplication problem and 10still had not lost all my baby teeth.  11I think we can all agree that someone of 12this maturity level should not be sexually active.  13But I was.  Without my knowledge or consent I had 14engaged in my first sexual experience by kindergarten 15and joined an overwhelming statistic of sexual abuse 16victims.  17It took the media coverage of the sexual 18abuse scandal in the Catholic church and a friend 19confiding the details of her sexual abuse for me to 20realize that something was wrong.  I was 12 years old 21when I told my parents, when Larry rubbed my feet, he 22used his penis.  My parents confronted him and he 23denied any such action.  24Due to complex details that I won't get 255into here, my parents chose to believe Larry Nassar 1over me.  2I spent the years between 12 and 18 3avoiding and detaching from my family.  To my father, 4someone who makes such heinous false accusations is 5the worst type of person.  His belief that I had lied 6seeped into the foundation of our relationship.  7Every time we got into a fight he would tell me, you 8need to apologize to Larry.  9I learned to ask for very little as I 10wanted my parents to know that I didn't need them, 11just as I felt they didn't want me.  12It wasn't until I was about to leave for 13college when my father again pulled a need to 14apologize card and then I took another chance of 15clearing my name.  I told him that I wasn't lying and 16that Larry Nassar had indeed sexually abused me.  17Larry Nassar's actions had already caused 18me significant anguish, but I hurt worse as I watched 19my father realize what he had put me through.  20My father and I did our best to patch up 21our tattered relationship before he committed suicide 22in 2016.  Admittedly, my father was experiencing 23debilitating health issues, but had he not had to 24bear the shame and self-loathing that stemmed from 25602/13/2018 09\n",
      "13\n",
      "26 AMPage 7 to 10 of 2174 of 57 sheetshis defense of Larry Nassar, I believe he would have 1had a fighting chance for his life.  2Larry Nassar wedged himself between myself 3and my family and used his leverage as my parents' 4trusted friend to pry us apart until we fractured.  5And fractured we did.  6My relationship with my mother is still 7marbled with pain, anger, and resentment, and for a 8long time I told people that I did not have a family.  9I think it is important to note my 10relationship with the Nassar family after I accused 11him at age 12.  A year or two passed from the time 12that I made the accusation and our families began to 13spend time together again.  I was around 14 years old 14when Stephanie began pressuring me to babysit the 15Nassars' three children.  I responded with dismissive 16answers for a lengthy period of time before 17relenting.  18It was at this point that I began to feel 19brainwashed.  At home I was a liar and when I was at 20the Nassars, either with my family or babysitting, it 21was as if I never accused him.  I felt I was losing 22my grip on reality.  I started to question whether 23the abuse ever really happened.  For my own sanity, I 24forced myself to walk through the abuse step by step 257so I didn't forget that I was not a liar.  It is to 1this that I credit my ability to recall the abuse so 2well throughout this process.  3As I continued to babysit for the Nassars I 4started to become resolved to my purpose there.  With 5two young girls in the home I felt protective and 6that somehow my presence there would make a 7difference.  For seven years and several years into 8counseling -- for seven years and several years into 9counseling I cared for those children with all my 10heart.  My detachment from my family forced me to 11search for grants, participate in post-traumatic 12studies, ask for sliding scales, and babysit for the 13Nassars to pay for my own counseling.  14When I look back now, I realize that my 15spirit was broken, lost, and confused, but then all I 16could think is that I needed to be there for those 17children in whatever way I could.  It was not until I 18was 21 that I cut all ties with the Nassar family.  19The complex feelings of shame, disgust, and 20self hatred brought me bouts of depression, anxiety, 21eating disorders, and other compulsive conditions.  22Sometimes I think it's hard for people to translate 23these generic terms into reality.  For me, it was a 24girl crying on the floor for hours trying not to rip 258out too much of her hair.  For me, it was a girl 1wanting the pain to stop so badly that she woke up 2for months to the thought, I want to die.  For me, it 3was a girl getting out her gun and laying it on the 4bed just to remind herself that she has control over 5her own life.  For me, it was a girl that spent so 6much time trying to fix herself that she forgot what 7she actually enjoys doing.  8Sexual abuse is so much more than 9disturbing physical acts.  It changes the trajectory 10of a victim's life, and that is something that no one 11has the right to do.  12Your Honor, with your permission, I would 13now like to address the defendant.  14THE COURT\n",
      "  You may.15MS. STEPHENS\n",
      "  After my parents confronted 16you, they brought you back to my house to speak with 17me.  Sitting on my living room couch I listened to 18you tell me no one should ever do that, and if they 19do, you should tell someone.  Well, Larry, I'm here, 20not to tell someone, but to tell everyone.  21You convinced my parents that I was a liar, 22that you didn't keep lotion strategically placed in 23the basement so you could beat your penis in my face 24while I hid.  But I still get sick at the smell of 259that lotion.  1You convinced my parents that you didn't 2pull my feet into your lap, unzip your pants, and rub 3your erect penis against my bare skin, but I still 4flinch when my feet are near someone's lap.  5You convinced my parents that you didn't 6stick your fingers in my adolescent vagina, but I 7knew when it was time to use my first tampon not to 8worry because my hymen wasn't intact.  9You used my body for six years for your own 10sexual gratification.  That is unforgiveable.  11I have been coming for you for a long time.  12I've told counselors your name in hopes that they 13would report you.  I have reported you to Child 14Protective Services twice.  I gave a testament to get 15your medical license revoked.  You were first 16arrested on my charges, and now as the only 17non-medical victim to come forward, I testify to let 18the world know that you are a repulsive liar and that 19those treatments were pathetically veiled sexual 20abuse.  21Perhaps you have figured it out by now, but 22little girls don't stay little forever.  They grow 23into strong women that return to destroy your world.  24Your Honor, there's no time that Larry 25105 of 57 sheetsPage 11 to 14 of 21702/13/2018 09\n",

      "26 AMNassar can serve that will give me back those years 1with my family or the time and energy I spent sorting 2out my anger, frustration, and confusion.  But I can 3tell you this, our law does not do enough to prevent 4predatory acts and often does not do enough to punish 5predators who have committed the hideous acts of 6abuse of a child.  7I can also tell you Larry Nassar is a 8predator without boundaries.  His patients weren't 9safe, his friends' children weren't safe, and even 10his own children weren't safe.  If he is ever allowed 11to reenter society, he will not hesitate to 12re-offend.  13We have all done our part to get to this 14point and will continue to do our part to combat the 15diseased societal thinking that kept a hundred plus 16victims quiet for decades, but right here, right now 17it's your turn.  I implore you to do your part, make 18a statement that forces other predators to think 19twice.  Keep Larry Nassar out of our communities.  20I ask for a minimum of 40 and a maximum of 21125.  Thank you.  22THE COURT\n",
      "  Thank you.  The system clearly 23failed you and it has failed so many children, people 24without voices, but you certainly have grown into a 2511beautiful, smart, intelligent woman who has a voice.  1This voice that you have just let out publicly will 2have that rippling effect to change legislation, to 3change the lives of children who are being abused, to 4speak up like you.  5What's so important is that you weren't 6sure what was going on but you kept questioning, and 7when you heard other voices, you knew it was wrong, 8and it's so important what you've just said to all 9those children and helpless people, and it is a shame 10that you are not alone, that your family didn't 11listen, that they trusted the abuser, but you as a 12small child had nothing to gain, nothing by 13complaining, and still your voice went unheard.  14I promise you you're not unheard now.  I 15have one question for you.  Are you seeking 16restitution from Larry Nassar?  17MS. STEPHENS\n",
      "  No. 18THE COURT\n",

You 21paid for your own counseling, so it's something that 22I can order to make you financially whole.  I 23understand you may never fully feel whole, but I 24think you're on your way to healing, but for those 2512needs that you might have, I certainly can order 1restitution.  2I don't know anything about the civil case.  3I kept myself away from other things that would 4affect that.  I don't know if you're part of that or 5not.  I don't know if that case will live or die.  I 6don't know what the judgment may or may not be.  7There's no guarantees with that. 8Restitution, there is a guarantee that if 9for some reason he has money, earned money, inherits 10money, whatever, goes to the victims first, so if 11that's something you would like, I can leave it open 12so you can think about it 13MS.

      "  Thank you.  Honorable Judge 2516Aquilina, thank you for giving me this opportunity to 1tell you how Larry Nassar has hurt me and the effect 2that this has had on my life. 3I am Jessica Thomashow, also known as 4victim A.  I was sexually assaulted by Larry Nassar 5when I was nine and 12 years old.  Today I am 17 and 6a senior in high school, and this is my story.  7My childhood was filled with happiness and 8love.  One of my loves was for gymnastics and for all 9my teammates in the gym.  Gymnastics was a big part 10of my childhood, and I spent many hours in the gym 11and at competitions, though, as you know, with 12gymnastics it is a very physically demanding sport 13and often comes with painful injuries.  14I remember one of my first injuries, a rib 15misplacement.  This was the first time I heard of 16Larry Nassar and his reputation.  I remember telling 17my mom that my coaches told me I should see Larry 18Nassar for my injury, and to my surprise, she knew 19who he was.  She had trained under him when she went 20to medical school at Michigan State University.  21One night my coaches arranged for me to see 22Nassar after practice to help with my rib injury.  23Monday nights were when Larry Nassar came to Twistars 24to treat injured team gymnasts.  I remember my 2517coaches telling me to go see him, and I was actually 1quite excited.  Then I went into the back room, and 2that's when everything changed.  3I was alone in the back room with him.  He 4had me lie down on the table and he sexually 5assaulted me.  He touched the most innocent places on 6my body that day.  7I remember fear and pain and asking myself, 8what is happening?  When it was over, I was so 9confused.  What had he just done to me, and why?  It 10was awful and embarrassing.  I left and kept the 11disgusting thing that had just happened to me to 12myself.  13Two years passed.  I saw him several times 14again at his clinic at MSU, always with my mom, and 15they were normal appointments.  Then in 2012 it 16happened again, right around my 12th birthday.  I had 17a stress fracture in my ankle and my dad took me to 18that appointment.  Before Nassar assaulted me, we had 19a great, meaningful conversation about my future.  He 20asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, and I 21said, I want to be just like you, a sports medicine 22doctor.  23He gave me a gift, a pin from the Olympics, 24and told me, when you take my place as the new sports 25187 of 57 sheetsPage 19 to 22 of 21702/13/2018 09\n",
      "13\n",
      "26 AMmedicine doctor for gymnastics, then you can give me 1back this pin.  Nassar then told my dad he had to 2massage my ankle and it would be okay for him to wait 3in the waiting room.  4After he left, Nassar told the medical 5student to leave the room, too.  After the room was 6cleared, he did it yet again.  He slid his ungloved 7hand up my leg and back into the most innocent part 8of my body, and I felt searing pain.  For 30 minutes 9he inserted his fingers into me and grunted while I 10lay there terrified.  11Again I was confused by what had just 12happened.  He was a trusted doctor and what he did to 13me didn't make sense in my child's mind.  I didn't 14tell a sole, and I try not to think about it anymore, 15but my dream of becoming a sports medicine doctor 16ended that day along with my happy and trusting self.  17He had broken me.  18I lived the next several years in limbo.  19Being sexually assaulted has changed me into an 20anxious teen, but I did not know that I had been 21abused and that was the source of my anxiety.  I no 22longer felt safe, and I had problems with trust.  23My parents took me to a psychiatrist and a 24therapist when I was in ninth grade and this 2519happened.  I was diagnosed with and treated for 1social anxiety disorder and saw a therapist on a 2weekly basis but did not have insight into the cause.  3In the seventh and eighth grade I felt 4extremely uncomfortable around my male teachers.  I 5avoided them.  I hated talking to them, and I would 6feel panic if I was ever alone with them in a room.  7Back then I didn't understand why I felt 8this way because all my peers loved our teachers, but 9being assaulted affected my relationship with my 10teachers and my anxiety was so intense that it made 11it hard to focus and learn at school.  12I also developed an intense fear of male 13hands, like a PTSD response.  Now I get flashbacks 14when I see male hands and it makes me feel scared and 15threatened.  This fear changed the way I grew up and 16how I related to boys.  I did not want to hold hands 17or ever be close to my guy friends.  I couldn't be 18just a normal girl anymore, and I have forever lost a 19big piece of my childhood due to his abuse.  20When the first IndyStar article came out my 21life changed.  I put the pieces together and realized 22I was molested by Larry Nassar.  I thought back to my 23appointments with him and could still feel what my 24nine and 12 year old self felt then; alone, scared, 2520and in pain.  I wanted to puke.  I could feel his 1hands touching me, and that was the first time I had 2my first flashback, and to this day I still have 3them.  The flashbacks are paralyzing.  I had one just 4two weeks ago at school and could barely get out of 5my seat.  Thankfully I was able to stop my brain and 6went to the office.  I cried for an hour shaking with 7fear.  8I would like to say something to my abuser, 9Larry Nassar.  10You took advantage of my innocence and 11trust.  You were my doctor and I trusted you and you 12took complete advantage of that.  Why?  I used to ask 13myself that question all the time, especially while I 14was laying in bed crying myself to sleep.  What you 15did to me was so twisted.  You manipulated me and my 16entire family.  How dare you.  17You had no right to do that, and because of 18your decision to molest me, you have caused so much 19pain in my life, and for the rest of my life I'm 20going to have to heal from what you did.  21Your Honor, I understand the plea 22guidelines are for a minimum sentence range of 25 to 2340 years, and I ask you to give Larry Nassar a 40 24year minimum to 125 year maximum sentence for what he 2521did to me.  I also ask on behalf of what he did to 1over a hundred other girls, we are all suffering 2having flashbacks, unable to have normal 3relationships, crying at night, feeling broken, and 4our lives have been forever changed.  He is a 5predator, and he won't be stopped unless he is behind 6bars for the rest of his life.  Thank you.  7THE COURT\n",
      "  Are you asking for restitution?  8MS. THOMASHOW\n",
      "  Undecided right now. 9THE COURT\n",
      "  Okay.  I'm going to leave 10restitution open.  I'm going to decide how long.

      "  Your Honor, today I stand before 23you simply as victim D in the Ingham County case.  I 24am a minor and presently have not come forward with 2525my identity.  I am a sheltered Christian, 1home-schooled girl who is still in competitive 2gymnastics.  3From a young age I was raised to respect 4those in authority.  I was also taught that there are 5certain people who are there to help you; doctors, 6teachers, pastors, police officers, so going to see 7Nassar at the age of 13 it was -- that was my belief 8system, that he was there to help me.  9I can remember the first time he assaulted 10me like it was yesterday.  I cried all the way home 11because of what he did to me.  He made me feel so 12yucky that I could not imagine this is what I had to 13endure to get better.  But I was 13.  I had never 14heard of a doctor purposely hurting someone.  13 when 15this began happening and 15 when I realized what 16happened; 15, a sophomore, and now a junior in high 17school.  18What many people referred to as the best 19years of their life might have been the worst years 20of my life.  I can hardly explain what this past year 21and a half was like.  It was meetings and court 22appearances with attorneys, prosecutors, 23investigators, counselors.  It felt like endless 24meetings going back over a story that was so personal 25269 of 57 sheetsPage 27 to 30 of 21702/13/2018 09\n",
      "13\n",
      "26 AMto talk about.  What 15 year old girl wants to 1discuss their private parts with grown men, or anyone 2for that matter?  It was embarrassing.  It was 3emotional, and I dreaded every meeting and court 4appearance I ever had to endure because it meant I 5was going to speak the assault out loud for everyone 6in the room.  Every time it forced me to relive the 7horrible experience again.  That was overwhelming.  8It caused sleepless nights, lots of stress 9because I was trying to balance school, competitive 10gymnastics, which is a lot of time and travel, and 11then this awful situation, all while trying to have 12somewhat of a normal teenage life.  13I did not want anyone to know.  I did not 14come out to my teammates and friends until right 15before I had to go to court in May.  Even right now I 16wrestled with lying to reveal my identity so that I 17no longer feel like I am hiding.  Plus, it would be 18nice to be able to say I'm a survivor.  But at the 19same time I am unsure.  I do not want anyone to look 20at my differently, especially when I walk out on the 21gymnastics floor.  I want to be known for who I am 22and my gymnastics, not for being a victim of Larry 23Nassar.  24This situation has also affected my family.  2527Being only 15 when I realized I was sexually 1assaulted my parents have been heavily involved.  2This has been extremely hard on my mom with lots of 3feeling of guilt for being in the room, for trusting, 4and for not asking enough questions.  She cries a 5lot, but she was determined to fight for justice for 6me and all the victims.  7My dad, it's just hard hearing the story 8over and over again.  Knowing what this monster did 9to his little girl makes him sick.  In front of me he 10tries to remain strong.  11My siblings have paid a price because it 12has often consumed our time and our days.  Part of 13our devastation is just knowing the time frame in 14which I was assaulted, starting in July 2014, knowing 15it could have been easily avoided.  If anyone -- if 16one or any of the stipulations had been enforced by 17anyone overseeing Nassar, this would have never 18happened.  To my knowledge, I am the first known 19victim after he was allowed to go back to work in 20July 2014.  That fact is almost inconceivable to us, 21that he was so brazen to do the sexual assault in 22front of my mom, but also knowing he was still under 23investigation.  It actually speaks volumes to what he 24knew he could get away with because no one was truly 2528watching.  He had mastered his performance, his act, 1his actions, his every move.  2To Larry Nassar, here are some of my 3thoughts.  You had it all, prestigious doctor, 4family, career, loved, worshipped by the gymnastics 5community, smart, honors, the list could go on and 6on, and you allowed evil to take over every part of 7you and committed some of the worst acts imaginable, 8on children.  The innocent, the trusting.  9I cannot even comprehend this at 16 years 10old.  I may not ever be able to comprehend what you 11did and what you threw away, all for your evil 12desires.  13Your apology/words at the hearing in 14November was not an apology.  If the judge gives you 15an opportunity to speak again before sentencing, you 16need to try again.  You need to sincerely apologize, 17not for the crazy words you spoke before about why 18you took the guilty plea, for the community to heal, 19that you never intended for this forest fire to get 20out of control.  Even at 16 years old I know those 21are silly statements.  It was not an apology to any 22victim or their family, but the victims need to hear 23you say I am sorry, please forgive me.  I made 24terrible decisions that were based on my own desires 2529with no regards of how I was hurting you that day and 1forever.  I manipulated so many people, all part of 2my scheme to be able to do what I ultimately wanted 3to do, and now I am begging, if you ever can, to 4forgive me for my disgusting actions.  Those are the 5types of sentences you need to say.  6Now I want you to know I stand today not as 7your judge, eventually that is God's job.  I stand 8today knowing that God's forgiveness extends to the 9worst offenses.  I stand today praying that God 10extends the same grace to you and that you reach out 11and take it, but you do need to ask him for it.  12I also stand today extending my forgiveness 13to you, not because you deserve it, but because our 14family will allow this tragic event to frame -- will 15not allow this tragic event to frame our lives, so we 16release this poison by extending forgiveness.  17Your Honor, what I want you to know -- what 18I want you to know most is I am only 16.  My whole 19life is ahead of me.  Most people as they grow up get 20to write their own story.  They make choices that 21affect the next days of their lives.  They make good 22choices and bad choices, but with each decision they 23are paving the way for their own stories.  They write 24it, their story.  253002/13/2018 09\n",

How it 6will affect my relationships, schooling, decisions, 7trusts of others, especially doctors and men all is 8unknown.  I do not want this to defeat me, define me, 9outshine me, or confine me.  But it will always be a 10part of my story.  I still have a lot ahead.  What 16 11year old or anyone has to or wants to go through all 12of this?  13Just writing this statement has been 14stressful and emotional.  There are not enough words 15to convey my actual feelings.  Plus there seems to be 16endless things I could or want -- plus there seems to 17be endless things I could or want to say.  The list 18could go on forever.  19Even as I work on my statement with my mom, 20we cry.  As this settles I will turn the page and 21begin a new chapter, one that I will write myself.  I 22pray and trust the Lord will be all I need to sustain 23me from this affecting my story.  24Larry Nassar wrote his own story.  He made 2531decisions, awful disgusting decisions, and those 1decisions should affect the rest of his life.  We do 2not want him to ever have a chance to write on 3anyone's story.  4You now have the unique opportunity, one 5that you have earned, to be able to write on his 6story.  My family and I have prayed for you.  We have 7prayed that your sentence is the maximum number of 8years but within the parameters of what the Attorney 9General and prosecutor have established.  As you 10write on his story, please remember that you are 11writing on behalf of all the victims whose stories 12Larry Nassar wrote on.  May your decision be a 13reflection of that number and the disgusting crimes 14he committed.  Thank you.  Victim D.  15THE COURT\n",
      "  Thank you so much for being so 16brave at 16 to read all of that.  His story ends in 17prison.  Yours is unwritten.  You have the power and 18you've just taken the power to rewrite this headline. 19You are strong.  You have insight.  And you 20are in control.  So as you said in your statement and 21as I always say to victims, this should not define 22you, and I think already you've broken out of that 23mold, and I'm really proud of you, having you stand 24here.  2532Are you and your family asking for 1restitution?

You should be proud 2of her, but my job at sentencing is restitution and 3trying to make people whole, and I'm sure that you 4have -- obviously whole doesn't mean what it actually 5means.

      "  No.  She couldn't be with us 18today but I'm going to be telling you from a victim's 19mother's point of view what our life has been like 20since her abuse from Larry Nassar, but I first wanted 21to tell you that my daughter was adopted from South 22Korea and I got a call from our social worker that 23wanted to know if we would be willing to take a baby 24that had some medical issues in August of 1985, and 2535we said, yes, and at that time she -- we picked her 1up at the airport and she had a fractured skull and 2she -- both of her ears were damaged.  She was 3delivered in a hospital using forceps and she 4required several surgeries, but for a whole year I 5sat up with this baby at night because she couldn't 6lay down, and the bond that came from her and I was 7just inseparable.  We did everything together as she 8continued to grow up.  9Her childhood was a normal childhood and 10she wouldn't leave my side, and I needed to get her 11to be social with other kids so I enrolled her in 12Montessori, and for a whole week she screamed like a 13pig being cut because she thought I was leaving her, 14and finally on the fifth day she said, mommy, I know 15you'll be back.  I said, yes, I will.  16I'm sorry.  During her normal childhood 17she, you know, wanted to do all the activities that 18all her little friends did, and we had these Saturday 19morning classes and the gymboree and the whatever, 20swim lessons, and so she really caught on to 21gymnastics, and she was enrolled at Artistic 22Gymnastics Academy in Roseville, Michigan, and her 23Saturday morning hour classes turned into several 24times a week, and then the coaches asked her if she 2536would like to join team and I said, well, it's going 1to be her decision but she needed to understand the 2requirements and that she needed to understand the 3commitment of what it meant and the dedication, and 4she said, yes, this is what she wanted to do 5Well, that became five days a week, 6sometimes six, and she was made -- she went to team 7really quick because she was really good.  8However, during -- she took a fall off of 9the beam and she injured her lower back and I asked 10our coach, I said, who should we go see?  And at this 11time she was ten years old.  And so -- and this was 12in 1995.  And so they said, you know, go -- they 13referred us to Larry Nassar, and I said, okay.  14Well, at the time we really didn't know, 15you know, much about him other than his medical 16reputation, so we went to see him and we traveled all 17the way from the east side of Michigan to Lansing, 18you know, several times a month for treatment. 19The last time that we went to treatment she 20was at that time 12 years old, and we had this thing, 21her and I, that we would, after her doctor visit, we 22would go to this little cafe in East Lansing and have 23lunch and enjoy each other for a while before we had 24that long drive back home, and so we got in the 2537car -- and I had been in the room with her during her 1examination, as usual, and I said, are you ready to 2go to lunch and she's, like, no, mom, I just want to 3go home.  And I said, what's wrong?  Are you in pain?  4And she said, mom, I just want to go home.  And I 5said, okay.  6So we got in the car and I said -- and she 7started bawling and I said, Chelsey, tell me what's 8wrong.  And she said, mom, he put his fingers in me 9and they weren't gloved, and I said, Chelsey, I was 10right there in the room, and she goes, you couldn't 11see what was going on, mom.  And she said, he hurt 12me.  And I said, Chelsey, we're going back right now.  13And I -- I mean, I was literally going to drive 14across the median on 96, and she said, mom, please 15don't do that.  I said, why?  And she said, because 16you don't understand, everybody will know, and 17everybody will judge me, and the judges will know 18when I compete, and I said, Chelsey, I can't do that, 19I have to go back.  Mom, please, we'll just find 20another doctor, and she begged me, and she was 21hysterical.  And I said, okay.  You know, I said, 22I'll talk to your dad about it, but I may end up 23going back, Chels.  24So she went back to the gym the next day 253802/13/2018 09\n",
      "13\n",
      "26 AMPage 39 to 42 of 21712 of 57 sheetsand I told her coach -- his name was Tim, and I told 1Tim about it, and he said, oh, no, that couldn't have 2happened.  I've known Larry for years.  And I said, 3well, Tim, it did happen.  So I told him I just 4wanted him to know what had happened.  So when I went 5into the balcony and was sitting with the rest of the 6moms, I said, You know, did any of your girls see 7Larry Nassar for treatment and a couple of them said, 8yes, and they said -- I said, did anything -- did 9they ever say anything about unusual behavior on his 10part?  And they said, well, no.  You know, they give 11me this look like you're lying to me, but anyways, 12that was neither here nor there at the time because 13they weren't going to say anything.  14So we started a path of destruction, and 15her path of destruction was -- she was doing horrible 16in school.  She had this self loathing.  I had her 17see a psychiatrist and it didn't seem to be helping.  18There was a lot of self blame.  She had managed to 19get through -- she had quit gymnastics the following 20year when she was 13 because she went to a meet here 21in Lansing at Twistars, I believe it was, and he was 22there and she fell off of every apparatus, she did 23horrible, and she said, I can't do this anymore 24because every time I see him I just flash back to 2539what happened in his office. 1She made bad decisions.  It affected her 2social life.  She started running with bad crowds.  3She got into drugs and she never really recovered.  4The person that was my best friend, we used to do 5everything together, we would watch movies, we both 6loved movies -- as a matter of fact, I hate to admit 7it but on a rainy day we went to see four movies and 8only paid for one, but we would bake cookies 9together, and she loved the holidays, and she would 10decorate the house and I didn't have to do anything.  11She just kind of, like, took over.  12So she did come out of it a little bit.  13She had suffered a rape at a concert, that was 14another thing that compounded her issues.  I think 15the thing that her -- the worst part for her was that 16this was a man that was supposed to be the best in 17his field.  He was supposed to help her.  He was 18supposed to help her heal.  But he didn't.  He abused 19her.  He sexually abused her, and he had the audacity 20to do that while I was sitting right there in the 21room.  22I know that the other girls have similar 23stories.  We all have the same story, but for my 24daughter it just became a serious, serious bought of 2540depression, and so in 2009 she took her own life 1because she couldn't deal with the pain anymore, and 2it will be ten years in March that I lost my baby.  3She was 23 years old.  She would have been 33 now.  4And every day I miss her.  Every day.  And it all 5started with him.  It all started with him.  It just 6became worse as the years went by until she couldn't 7deal with it anymore.  8And you don't know what it's like to be at 9work and get a call to come home immediately, and you 10know, a mother's instinct tells you something is 11wrong, and you pull up in your driveway and the 12medical examiner is there and your daughter is in a 13body bag and they're loading her into the van.  14It has destroyed our family.  We used to be 15so close.  My husband and I -- I went through four 16years of intense therapy trying to deal with all of 17this until I could finally accept the fact that this 18was not my fault.  It was the fault of Larry Nassar 19that started all this with my daughter, and as you 20can see, she turned into a beautiful young lady who 21was really, really sick.  And that's my story for 22her.  23THE COURT\n",

      "  Your Honor, life through a 21child's eyes is a place where bad things don't make 22sense.  Rarely do you see or hear a child that 23doesn't smile at the thought of life.  A child is 24just what I was, a 13 year old who didn't see the 2544world as a terrifying place, not until I was faced 1with the life changing experience that stole my 2innocence far too young.  Not until the day that you, 3Mr. Nassar, violated the right to be called a doctor 4and took something from I and all of the other strong 5women that stand behind me today. 6I was in a state of great desperation when 7I paid my visit to Doctor Nassar, or as he liked his 8patients to refer to him, Larry.  Prior to my visit I 9had been recommended by gymnastic coaches.  I heard 10words such as, you'll love him.  He's a miracle 11worker.  He can fix anyone or anything.  12Thinking back to these words filling my 13naive mind, all I can think of is how this man, 14someone who held so many high credentials, was the 15monster who left me with more pain and scars than I 16came to his office with, the pain of never trusting 17someone physically again and the scars of being 18touched and exposed in places that were completely 19inappropriate.  20That day in the office is a day that will 21never be forgotten.  My family and I drove from 22Naperville, Illinois, to Mr. Nassar's office at the 23Michigan State facility in Lansing, Michigan.  I 24can't begin to explain the feeling I had moments 2545after this immoral act had been performed.  1I got a moment to myself after the assault 2when I sat in the bathroom at the facility.  I sat 3there in great disbelief, complete shock, and total 4humiliation.  I couldn't fathom the idea of what had 5just occurred.  6There isn't a day that goes by since July 71st, 2013, that I don't cringe at the disturbing 8violation that this man had put me through.  This 9horrific headline had finally reached the media three 10years later of too many girls losing something that 11should have never been stolen; innocence, privacy, 12safety, and trust.  13One day about three weeks after this had 14initially hit the news I was sitting in English class 15and we were discussing the meaning of the word 16depravity.  This word means wickedness or performing 17immorally corrupt acts.  The example my English 18teacher gave to further explain this disturbing word 19was this.  One day about -- excuse me.  The other day 20I saw in the news that an Olympic gymnastic doctor 21had -- that was the moment I was dreading, that 22moment where I had become the victim of a 23heartbreaking news story that my English teacher was 24casually discussing in class.  Of course, she was 254602/13/2018 09\n",
      "13\n",
      "26 AMPage 47 to 50 of 21714 of 57 sheetsunaware.  Everyone was.  My face was filled with 1terror and panic as soon as the words Olympic 2gymnastic doctor filled the room.  I sat in my desk 3shaking as if I was back in that office being 4violated.  5I previously described how this event stole 6my innocence, and that is what carries with me to 7this day.  For years I was afraid to give myself and 8my trust to anyone.  I wasn't willing to be heard 9again.  I had tried to hold on to every bit of 10innocence I felt I had left.  I was terrified to date 11anyone because I knew that physically and mentally I 12couldn't get past this internal barrier.  I was 13afraid to lose myself to another person who didn't 14deserve it.  15Last year I found someone who took me in 16and handled me with great care.  I learned to trust 17his loving arms and appreciate the endless love he 18had for me despite my intimacy issues.  I finally 19feel as though I got my innocence back.  I gained 20back what I lost unexpectedly, and I'm grateful for 21that every day.  22I'm speaking on behalf of all the girls who 23experienced this tragedy, whether it was one time or 24multiple times.  Once is far too much to be put 2547through.  Some may be scared to share their 1experience.  I was.  I still am sometimes.  There are 2some days that this horrifying experience fills my 3brain and I can't think about anything else.  4It left a mental scar that unfortunately 5will always be something that happened.  However, I 6am a strong believer that wounds heal into scars and 7these scars become stories that you share and heal 8from each day as time goes on.  A voice must be heard 9in order for all these victims of this tragic event 10to reach a level of closure.  Justice must be served.  11I am speaking to all the parents out there, 12including my own, who could have been in the very 13room that this event happened but was manipulated 14into believing that Mr. Nassar was healing us, as any 15normal doctor is supposed to do.  You are not to 16blame.  I can tell you that the thought of, well, if 17my parents would have just done, has never crossed my 18brain, and I can speak of other daughters who 19experienced this as well.  20To all the significant others of these 21girls, nothing means more to them than the way you 22love them and show them how to love themselves.  That 23is only going to help us heal, so thank you to both 24parents and significant others for going through 2548these horrifying events with us and being there as a 1shoulder to cry on or a hand to squeeze tight.  2To all the girls that have shown so much 3bravery throughout this, I could not be more proud of 4each and every one of you.  Although I may not know 5each of you personally, I can stand here and say that 6you are all my heroes.  7Lastly, a few words to Mr. Larry Nassar.  8You broke and shattered a lot of girls.  You 9manipulated us to trust you because you're a doctor 10and doctors do no wrong, only heal.  You are not a 11healer.  You performed acts of depravity just as my 12English teacher described.  You are also the one that 13must face what you have done for the rest of your 14life.  I am no longer broken by you.  15Every day I grow a new strength and look 16into the mirror to see a strong, unbreakable person.  17Nothing will ever take away what you have done to me 18or to the others that stand behind me.  However, we 19can walk free and radiate the strength that we have 20gained from your horrific acts, something you will 21never be able to do.  22Although I no longer see the world through 23a child's eyes, I have become this powerful 24individual that is taking this opportunity to speak 2549for what I believe in.  I am not the only one who 1suffered from these acts, and I know that this is not 2an easy thing to hear.  The fact of the matter is 3that it doesn't matter if this topic is uncomfortable 4to listen to or discuss.  It is something that 5happened and needs to be addressed,6I am hopeful that this letter not only 7speaks to those in this room or those involved with 8this case but to anyone who hears of these headlines.  9These acts were completely immoral and horrific and I 10am confident that Mr. Nassar will get what he 11deserves.  In the meantime, I hope that the effects 12that this tragedy has had on young girls is strong 13enough to make a change.  14Initially when I was asked if I wanted to 15remain anonymous when I read my letter today I 16immediately thought, yes.  This is something about me 17that I have always been afraid to share with people.  18I couldn't help but fear that people were going to 19look at my differently when this was nothing -- this 20was something that I did not ask to happen to me.  21After thinking about it and taking time to cope with 22facing this fear of mine I decided to finally put a 23name to it.  I am Jade Capua, and I am a survivor.  24Thank you.  255015 of 57 sheetsPage 51 to 54 of 21702/13/2018 09\n",

Sadly, as you recognized and the other 5victims have recognized, you're not alone in this.  6It happens all the time and, unfortunately, here it 7was with a trusted doctor who shouldn't have been 8trusted.  9I can also see as you read your 10statement -- I know you don't have eyes in the back 11of your head, but I watched the faces of your 12parents.  They're also emotionally distraught but so 13very proud of you.  I can see it.  And that's so 14important to have them as your backup, your main 15people, and they're there.  Your scar turned into a 16powerful voice.  You're using it.  You're a role 17model and you're a hero for all children without 18voices, and your fellow victims, so I applaud you 19being here today, making the decision to go public.  20It makes a difference.  It's that rippling effect 21that will go on not just in America but I think 22around the nation in every country.  So thank you for 23your bravery.24MS. CAPUA\n",

      "  December 16, 2016, I woke up 13from a nightmare sweating yet chilled to the core.  I 14knew before months of defending the mastermind I knew 15I was one of them.  That afternoon thousands of 16graphic images were found on multiple computers and 17media devices.  I still think about that daily.  18For years Mr. Nassar convinced me that he 19was the only person who could help me recover from 20multiple serious injuries.  To me he was like a 21knight in shining armor.  But, alas, that shine 22blinded me from the abuse.  He betrayed my trust, 23took advantage of my youth, and sexually abused me 24hundreds of times.  For this I believe that Mr. 2552Nassar deserves the maximum sentence for which his 1actions deserve.  2As a nation we need to take control.  3Sexual offenders need to know that they cannot 4continue with the crimes they are committing, and 5that no matter how long it takes for a survivor to 6come forward, their crimes will be exposed and their 7actions will be admonished.  8Sexual assault and harassment should not be 9a part of our culture.  Mr. Nassar should never be 10allowed to look at, talk to, or touch another young 11person again.  12I was an innocent nine year old with a 13broken pelvis that was willing to trust and allowed 14the doctor to do anything to help it feel better.  I 15had no reason not to.  He treated a few of my 16cousins.  He was friends with my mom and aunts.  He 17had pictures of Olympians and thank you notes from 18floor to ceiling in that MSU Sports Medicine office.  19I gazed at them during every appointment.  I knew the 20story behind many of the portraits, he shared them 21with me.  I was the 18 year old preparing to go away 22to college, apprehensive, and just hoping my body 23would be able to withstand four more years of the 24sport that defined my life.  Ten years of abuse and 2553neglect.  1I don't like the word victim.  Being a 2victim implies the desire for pity.  I am a survivor, 3but more so, I am me, and those ten years are a part 4of my story.  They have helped to define who I am 5today.  Today I am more guarded than I was a year ago 6but I also am wiser and more aware.  Today it is my 7job to be an even better role model and mentor and to 8be an advocate in saying that this does not define 9the sport of gymnastics or the medical profession.  10I have the honor of working with young 11girls every day.  They listen to what I say, get 12notifications every time I post to Instagram, analyze 13what I do, pick up on my vocabulary and copy how I 14dress.  It is my job to teach them to be humble and 15kind, strong willed and determined, gritty and 16confident.  It is my job to teach these girls that 17they can be the most powerful, amazing, and 18influential humans if they so choose and to help them 19realize that they have a voice and they have the 20ability to stand up for what they believe in.  It is 21my job to ensure that every nine year old I work with 22knows that she has an amazing future ahead of her and 23to ensure that every 18 year old I know realizes that 24she has the power to define who she is, that no 255402/13/2018 09\n",

That truth will one day be exposed.  6But it is my job to make a difference and an impact 7on the world and to help stop monster-like humans 8from abusing their power.  9I am working on forgiving you, Mr. Nassar.  10One day I will be able to, but I will never forget 11what you have done.  I must ask you this, are you 12remorseful for your actions in all of the lives you 13have changed forever?  Do you regret misusing your 14medical dominance?  I could hear it in your voice 15that November day when you pled guilty.  You are 16sorry for the pain that you have caused.  You had the 17same sincerity as you told me the story of why you 18blame yourself for sweet ********** birth story, as 19you hugged me at your brother Mike's funeral, and all 20of those times you told me I just needed to rest and 21could not compete.  22Saying that you did nothing for me would be 23a lie.  You helped to heal me.  My fragile bones, 24that is.  You shared your knowledge and gave me some 2555invaluable advice, but you also abused your power and 1mytrust in you, and that is not okay.  2My love for humanity is greater than the 3fear of the unknown.  My voice is louder than my 4inner thoughts.  My hope for change is more 5prevailing than my desire to ask why me, why was I 6the nine year old?  7This past year I have had countless somber 8days and incredibly long sleepless nights.  I 9clenched my jaws as I heard strangers wonder how he 10really did what he did and turn the other way as I 11saw her face on the front page of the newspapers in 12the gas station.  I have held back tears when friends 13ask how I was holding up.  I have looked into my 14parents' hardened eyes, seeing their pain from now 15knowing that their only child was molested right in 16front of them in the same room.  When no one is 17around I have cried and sobbed, felt a rush of every 18emotion and solidified my belief that I have the most 19amazing family and an incredible circle of friends.  20And I have had to think through and talk 21about the hundreds, hundreds of appointments and 22Nassar home visits and cringe at all of the times I 23should have said something about the improper 24treatments and oath breaking moments.  But I didn't, 2556and I cannot look back anymore.  1I am determined to be more involved in 2making this world a better place.  I can use my 3voice, my education, and my experiences to help stop 4females and males alike for not standing up for 5themselves and others.  After all, darkness cannot 6drive out darkness, only light can do that.  Hate 7cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.8THE COURT\n",

I can still remember the feeling of 14disbelief last October when I realized that what I 15had thought was medical treatment over ten years ago 16was actually sexual abuse.  17This case has taken all of me, every ounce 18of my being to press forward.

      "26 AMdone.  My children and my husband get less than my 1best due to the many sleepless nights and layered 2days of scratching and clawing to stay afloat.  3Prior to realizing what you had done to me 4I was a woman who once woke up each day with a smile, 5positive attitude, and end the day with just enough 6leftover energy to play with my children and 7successfully put a mark on another day.  I gave 8humans the benefit of earning my trust and most often 9took the time to see good in most people 10The past year has been nothing like those 11times.  My days start with exhaustion from a less 12than restful night's sleep and they end with fatigue 13from all the distractions and emotions that fill each 14day.  15I have always believed that I can 16accomplish whatever life throws my way with a restful 17night's sleep, and I cannot sleep because of what you 18have done.  I have made jokes in the past saying that 19I've never witnessed a bad's night sleep and for that 20I was forever grateful for God giving me the ability 21to sleep soundly.  Over the last year I have cried 22more nights than not and I have experienced flashback 23nightmares of the abuse.  I've woken up from such bad 24nightmares that I vomit.  The anxiety this has caused 2559me is what leaves me feeling like there is nothing 1more to give.  2Today I am a mother, a wife, a daughter, 3and friend that is struggling each day to find peace 4and joy in all things that once made me happy.  5Conversations are overtaken by Larry Nassar and the 6obvious pain in my voice is hard to avoid.  Those 7that truly know me know I will never be the same.  8November of last year I began seeing a 9therapist for what I now know is post-traumatic 10stress disorder.  My deepest pain and fear was the 11thought of my two young daughters ever being hurt 12like this.  The fear that invoked was crippling.  I 13was unable to send my children to daycare due to the 14paralyzing anxiety I was experiencing.  And birthday 15parties, sleep-overs, large crowds of people steal 16the joy of creating memories with my family.  Some 17day I will have to explain to my children why I am 18the way I am, my reasons for being cautious and 19fearful.  20My career has suffered tremendously from 21the distractions and the pain I am feeling.  There's 22not a day that passes that I don't think about the 23monster that created this mess.  The checklist of 24what needs to get done has never been harder to 2560accomplish and some days the details seem like a 1nearly impossible task.  2My mind is full of what is my new reality 3and my heart is aching from not being able to trust 4anybody around me.  For the past year I've held back 5with those that I love most.  I have become withdrawn 6from my every day life.  Life seems to be moving at a 7speed that I cannot keep up with and my peace of mind 8is forever taken away.  9I will always sacrifice myself as a parent.  10I went from once trusting full-heartedly to now not 11being able to trust at all.  The hardest battle I 12will continue to face is even in the situations you 13feel most safe, you can never let your guard down.  14If you can't trust a world-renowned doctor, who in 15this world can you trust?  16These feelings don't just stop from the 17abuse of Larry Nassar.  As if the struggle of what 18Larry Nassar did isn't bad enough, it's horrifying 19that MSU and USA Gymnastics are not stepping up to 20the plate to admit their wrongdoing.  21I have gone from a raving fan of MSU to now 22seeing green and white in the very same way as I do 23Larry Nassar.  I want MSU and USAG to know what they 24have done is on the very same level of accountability 2561as the crime Nassar has committed.  I strongly 1believe that MSU and USAG's inaction places an 2accountability on them for Nassar's access to minors 3which led to sexual abuse.  4MSU knew what was being done to these 5athletes and decided to turn a blind eye to keep 6their reputation strong and their pockets full.  If 7they would have only taken action upon the reporting, 8they would have saved me and all of these other women 9standing before us today from an afterlife full of 10pain and agony.  11As to what we now know of USAG, paying out 12to keep quiet is beyond my wildest dreams of wrong.  13Shame on you for looking the other way when this was 14brought to your attention.  15I'd like to take a moment to comment on MSU 16Board of Trustees as well as the president of MSU, 17Lou Anna Simon.  How convenient that you decided not 18to attend today.  You are a coward and your decision 19to watch from the sidelines is perfect representation 20of your lack of leadership.  21It sickens me that for 16 months you 22allowed Larry Nassar to continue to see young 23children under your guidance while he was under 24investigation for sexual abuse.  Now that this is a 256202/13/2018 09\n",

Have you 3ever thought to pick -- oh, sorry.  It would only 4make sense for you to speak directly to the victims 5to seek a better understanding of what had happened.  6Not once have you reached out to gather information 7or to ask how we are doing.  8We see how you're handling this matter, and 9I can tell you from a mother's experience that I 10expect better effort from my two young children.  A 11public apology after you hid behind this monster for 12over 20 years will never be enough.  13Where were you when we needed you?  If you 14would have only listened to all the women that 15brought complaints and concerns over all these years 16this would have saved so many children and women from 17being abused and from all the scars this has created.  18You have apologized for him and for the 19horrible things he has done.  That is not enough.  At 20what point will you look at yourselves in the mirror 21and realize that taking ownership of this matter is 22the only way to truly bring about change.  Until 23then, I will continue to fight for real answers.  24Lou Anna Simon and the board of trustees, 2563all the signs were there.  The complaints should have 1been enough for you to open your eyes and ears and to 2ensure that there was intentional follow through 3involved to protect the women under your care.  You 4failed all of us, and for that I see you in the same 5category of criminal as I do the criminal standing 6before us today.  7On the other hand, I am beyond grateful for 8the sentence Nassar received.  60 painful years of 9prison life surely brings relief to me.  Knowing you 10will never have the opportunity to hurt another human 11being is reassuring.  12As for the people at MSU and USAG, just 13know we will continue to fight to ensure that you're 14held accountable for not protecting young girls under 15your care from this day forward.  162018 brings newness for myself and my 17family.  Even though I will never be the same, I will 18continue to fight for trust, love, and, most of all, 19peace of mind.  I will slowly but surely begin to 20feel, to feel the joy of new experiences with my 21children, reconnect with friends who over the last 22year have gotten less than my best.  I will make 23strides to love with an untainted heart that is ready 24for new beginnings.  2564The pain will never fully pass from what 1you and the irresponsible organizations have done to 2myself and many others.  There's still so much 3uncertainty in life, but one thing is for sure, I 4will continue to press forward to seek what was once 5happiness.  I will educate my children about monsters 6like you and pray to God they will never experience 7pain like this.  There will be a day when I look into 8my soul and I will still see the scars of this 9nightmare, but I will no longer feel the deepness of 10your pain.  The scars will remind me that the past is 11real but the future is bright.  Thank you.  12THE COURT\n",

That's what 19you're about, and peace of mind, being here today, 20and that your boogie man, which all children fear, 21will not come out of prison, will not harm you or 22anyone else again.  23And you talk about wanting your children to 24understand and to keep them safe, and I suspect that 2565you will be like I am.  Because I hear so many vile 1cases I'm a bit overprotective, and my middle child 2calls herself Rapunzel because of me, because I only 3let her out after I carefully examine everything, and 4she does not like that, but my daughter also 5expressed a desire to be here and to hear your words 6and the words of the other victims, and I know that 7she's not the only teenager who wants to hear what 8you have to say, and so coming from you instead of 9me, from the parent she doesn't want to listen to, is 10so critical, and your children, too, will not only 11have your voice as the mother, even if they choose 12like my daughter to disregard my words, because all 13of you have come here together in strength.  She will 14be reassured, both your daughters -- they're girls, 15right?  Yes.  They'll both be reassured that your 16voice is one of hundreds and that you are right, so I 17think they will listen.  I actually pray and know 18they will listen because of your sincerity, and 19because being here today you have saved so many other 20victims and other voices will rise.

      "  Not playing was not an option, 22and my parents were obviously concerned, and through 23my mom's connections with MSU I was able to get an 24appointment with Larry.  2568I saw Larry once.  I remember him doing a 1scan on my body as I stood straight up in his office 2where he poked and prodded at me and he made various 3observations about my muscles and bone structure, et 4cetera.  My mom was in the room.  I was really into 5sports and, honestly, it was interesting to hear such 6a thorough examination of my body.  7After the standing examination was done 8Larry asked me to lay down on the exam table and he 9positioned himself so that he was between my 10midsection and where my mom was sitting so she 11couldn't see what was happening.  He kept prodding at 12and manipulating my legs and hips and stomach and at 13some point he said he was going to move his hands 14close to my vagina.  I've thought a lot about that 15statement in hindsight and I see now how devious and 16how practiced it must have been for him.  My mom knew 17this doctor would be getting close so no cause for 18concern, and I was expecting something to happen but 19I didn't know what.  I had absolutely no other 20medical or personal experience against which to 21compare what he was about to do, and he didn't talk 22me through what he was doing, so he molested me and 23he molested me with my mom in the room.  24My mom and I talked about the appointment 2569afterwards but I didn't really have the words for 1what Larry had done, and as a 15 year old girl I was 2embarrassed to talk to adults about something like 3that.  I had never seen a gynecologist.  I never had 4a pap smear, and at the time I thought this is what 5it meant to be a woman going to the doctors, awkward 6and embarrassing and uncomfortable but just part of 7the deal.  Besides, I thought he was looking out for 8me.  9It's been about 18 years since my 10appointment, and in that 18 years I have never had 11another health professional come close to touching me 12the way that he did.  At the time I had a sense that 13it was a strange appointment and if the university or 14police or someone actually looking to find something 15had asked either my mom or I about the experience, 16they would have put together a pattern of him acting 17far outside of normal behavior for a doctor, but no 18one asked us, and so after me, Larry had another 16 19odd years to molest and assault young women and 20girls.  21It sickens me to know that I was on the 22early side of his abuse.  He used those early 23appointments with people like my mom and I as a test 24case to see how far he could push the patient/doctor 257002/13/2018 09\n",

This last year and 10a half is about coming to terms with how naive and 11vulnerable I was.  I feel very stupid for not 12understanding what was happening at the time, really 13guilty for not contributing in some way to stop it 14sooner, and really, really emotional and vulnerable, 15but I also feel really lucky because I got to go 16through high school and I got to go through college 17and dating and I got to meet my future husband only 18thinking it was a weird doctor's appointment.  It's 19just in the last year that I've had to come to terms 20with what happened, but even in the last year it has 21changed me.  Larry's later victims knew they were 22victims at a much younger age so beyond molesting 23them, as you heard today, he's also robbed them of 24the innocence and carefree-ness that's supposed to 2571come with that time in our life.  1After today I don't plan to think about 2Larry unless I absolutely have to.  I get to keep 3living.  I get to keep looking forward to the future 4and what's next.  I get to keep having an incredibly 5rich and fulfilling life, and so do the other women 6who are here today, and so do the other women who 7haven't necessarily stepped forward, but that's not 8what he gets, and that's where I get my justice.  I'd 9like Larry to sit in prison for a very long time with 10no hope for what's next.11I also want to say I was abused once a long 12time ago.  I did not understand it was abuse until I 13was an adult, and even with that, this past year has 14still been a very emotional and trying time.  I can't 15imagine how difficult it's been for the charging 16victims.  17I don't want the women and families who 18testified against Larry to have to go through that 19again unless they want to, which is why I hope that 20even though these crimes warrant a lifetime or more 21in prison, you sentence Larry to the highest minimum 22of 40 years so that the plea deal is not jeopardized.23And I also want to close by saying thank 24you to you, to Detective Andrea Munford, to Rebekah 2572Snyder, Angela Povilaitis, to Rachael and IndyStar 1for shining a light on this and for the other women 2who stepped forward to end the abuse.  I know that it 3took a lot of people to catch and prosecute this 4person, and I appreciate the network that it's taken 5to get here.  Thank you.  6THE COURT\n",

There is no fault here in regard to the 20victims, even though they feel that way, so I am 21really proud of you for saying that you're not going 22to think about him anymore.  You shouldn't.

I am relieved that the truth 17finally came out, but I am angry with myself for not 18recognizing the abuse sooner, and I struggle with 19that daily.  However, I truly believe that even if I 20would have recognized the abuse and come forward 21several years ago, we would still be in this very 22same place today.  23Even as a 31 year old it was extremely 24uncomfortable to describe to my family and my parents 257421 of 57 sheetsPage 75 to 78 of 21702/13/2018 09\n",

      "26 AMthe graphic details of what you did to me.  Each time 1I had to describe it, whether to the police, my 2attorneys, my therapist, or in writing, it doesn't 3get any easier.  Having to relive my experiences over 4and over almost 20 years later brings back so many 5memories and emotions.  I even avoid talking to -- 6talking about it with those close to me because I get 7closed off and irritable.  8The fact that I was sexually abused by you 9is something that I'm still wrapping my head around.  10One of the hardest parts is seeing my parents carry 11any sense of responsibility for what happened because 12it is in no way their fault.  It's your fault.  13We all trusted Larry and are angry for the 14way you deceived us.  He's made it difficult to trust 15anyone.  The flashbacks of the hours spent alone in 16that exam room with him have at times kept me up at 17night.  My memories are vivid and it's hard to get 18images out of my head.  I remember how much it hurt 19but didn't want to speak up because I was afraid of 20what you would think of me.  I had to be strong.  21When I told my mom that it hurt, she 22thought I was referring to the pain in my back, not 23the pain in my vagina from the excruciating hours of 24assault that just took place.  2575For the first time in my life I sought 1therapy because I've realized this is something that 2I am not able to deal with on my own.  My therapist 3has helped me find ways to cope with my anxiety and 4emotions, but, more importantly, she's helped me to 5stop blaming myself.  6Larry, you are the one that should feel 7guilt and shame every day and have to live with that 8for the rest of your life.  Unfortunately, we as 9victims and survivors have to live with the damage 10you have caused for the rest of our lives, too.  11Your Honor, I'm asking for the full 12sentence set by the Attorney General's office because 13I am a hundred percent confident that if he had not 14been caught, he would continue to do this for the 15rest of his life.  Thank you.  16THE COURT\n",

Victims 18don't often recognize harm, sexual abuse, and you 19went to him for pain -- for healing, and you didn't 20know.  No one faults you or any other victim for 21that.  You were a child.  And even when it happens to 22adults, often they block it out, don't recognize it, 23don't see it for what it is for a long time because 24it's so very personal, so very difficult, and you're 2576only human, but you are a super human person for 1being here, all of the victims are for being here in 2public and saying what you did, so I applaud you, and 3I hope that although you've lost trust of so many 4people, that you trust the court to do the right 5thing.  I will.  I will make up my mind in a few days 6at sentencing when it comes to that stage, and I want 7everyone to know I'm going to honor the plea deal 8because I think everybody needs closure, not because 9I necessarily am happy with it, but the combined 10sentences I think will put your mind at ease, and 11hopefully you can trust the system, and I trust that 12you're going to have a very happy, fulfilled life.  13Thank you again for being here.14MS.

I talked with my parents and 10sister and thought the women that reported the sexual 11assault must be mistaken.  Even though I did not know 12this at the time, I had also gone through the same 13abuse beginning when I was 15 years old.  Today I 14know I was in the first stage of grief, denial.  15Denial that I could ever be a victim of sexual 16assault.  I was grieving that a person I respected 17and cared for had betrayed my trust, grieving the 18realization that I was sexually assaulted as a child.  19Prior to and even after my unfortunate 20contact with Larry Nassar I thought of myself as 21someone that was good at reading people.  However, 22Larry Nassar is a master manipulator.  His conniving 23and calculating behavior not only tricked me but he 24tricked my mom who was present for all my 257802/13/2018 09\n",
      "13\n",
      "26 AMPage 79 to 82 of 21722 of 57 sheetsappointments as a minor.  1After discovering the assault had taken 2place, my family and I were distraught with grief.  3My mom blamed herself and felt she should have asked 4more questions and been more guarded and skeptical 5about procedures.  The thought of my mom hurting and 6blaming herself was heartbreaking for me because 7never once did I think it was her fault.  8Anyone that has suffered sexual assault or 9loves someone who has needs to realize it's not their 10fault.  It is the sexual predator's fault, and in 11this case it is Larry Nassar's fault.  12Even though I accepted this abuse was out 13of my control to prevent, it has not lessened my 14depression and anxiety.  There are nights I lie awake 15crying, fearful of the nightmares that may come when 16I fall asleep, and when I'm awake the nightmare of 17this reality, my reality, is not much better.  18Not only am I depressed with the 19realization of what happened to me, I've had to go on 20living my same life with family and friends that have 21no idea what I'm going through.  Usually I'm a very 22outgoing and open person, but it's been difficult to 23be my true self without sharing this part of my past.  24What motivates me to come forward is my 2579strong belief that victims of sexual assault deserve 1to have a voice.  By publicly speaking out against 2Larry Nassar I'm not just speaking out for myself, 3I'm speaking out for all the girls and women of the 4past, present, and future that have been or will be 5affected by sexual assault 6A quote from Jasmin Kaur\n",
      "  Scream so that 7one day a hundred years from now another sister will 8not have to dry her tears wondering where in history 9she lost her voice.  10It's been a difficult road, to say the 11least, but I know in my heart our efforts will help 12women not only today but for years to come.  13Difficult times can either strengthen or break a 14person.  15I am proud to say that this experience, 16though extremely challenging and sometimes 17unbearable, has made me a stronger woman than I was 18before.  Through this strength I have learned to not 19be ashamed.  The only ones that should be ashamed are 20Larry Nassar and the institutions that enabled him 21and denied responsibility.  22I am thankful to the women that spoke out 23before me and gave me the courage to publicly share 24myname today.  I am no longer ashamed of speaking 2580out, I am proud to.  1It is disgraceful that it has taken this 2long for these girls and young women to have a voice 3and for that voice to be taken seriously.  It sickens 4meto know that over 20 years ago this abuse, my 5abuse, could have been avoided.  However, no one took 6the accusations seriously, or worse yet, no one 7cared.  8Due to the shameful negligence and 9indifference of Michigan State University and USA 10Gymnastics, myself and 150 plus girls and young women 11were sexually assaulted and abused by Larry Nassar.  12Although being a part of this case and publicly 13speaking my truth are actions I'm very proud of, my 14life would have been much easier if Larry Nassar was 15never a part of it.  If he was charged and convicted 16two decades ago it would have saved myself, the other 17victims, and all of our families and loved ones from 18immense amounts of pain and suffering that will now 19carry with us the rest of our lives.  20To the pain and lifelong impact the 21defendant has imposed on myself, my family, my loved 22ones, and so many others, I feel that Larry Nassar 23should receive the maximum sentence.

      "  Your Honor, Mr. Nassar 2sexually abused me over a number of years beginning 3when I was a young teenager.  He broke me.  He stole 4my innocence and exploited it for his own sick 5satisfaction.  6All aspects of my young life was torn 7apart.  I struggled in silence, shame, and confusion 8attempting to put the pieces of my life back 9together, but I will never be whole again.  The pain 10of the abuse continues to make me feel broken, 11insecure, fearful, and overall worthless.  At times 12these feelings become completely overwhelming that I 13engage in self destructive behavior and thought about 14killing myself. 15Feeling worthless is an extremely 16difficulty emotion to describe.  I would like you to 17imagine a time you turned off all the lights in a 18room and it was pitch black for a few moments before 19your eyes adjusted.  Feeling worthless is like that 20pitch blackness but your eyes never adjust.  You are 21just stuck in the darkness, a dark and empty space, 22and the more you search for any kind of light, the 23deeper you go into the desolate, apathetic, and 24fearful trap the darkness created.  You blame 2583yourself for not being able to pull yourself out of 1the darkness and, therefore, feeling -- a feeling of 2worthlessness increases.  3For other individuals their eyes would 4adjust or they would eventually find a light.  This 5is not the case for me since this pitch blackness is 6in my mind and the darkness has grown and entailed 7itself in every facet of my life.  I have tried to 8fight back against this darkness to feel worthwhile 9and worthy.  10From others' perspectives I may seem like 11hardened and accomplished.  I have achieved so much.  12In 2009 I graduated from undergrad.  2011 I graduated 13with my first master's degree, and 2014 with my 14second master's degree.  Then in 2016 I graduated 15with my doctorate, but I never once felt worthy of my 16accomplishments.  I never walked during commencement 17because I'm not worthy of the praise, 18congratulations, and pageantry of such a ceremony.  19I have previously engaged in self harming 20behaviors.  I have stayed in abusive relationships 21when I knew deep down that I should run long before I 22did run.  I have had good relationships that never 23lasted since I did not feel worthy of the honest and 24true love that was offered.  I was stuck in the pitch 2584blackness even though the other person was trying so 1hard to turn on the lights.  2The physical damage has also been 3monstrous.  In just the last four and a half years I 4have had three major back surgeries and too -- too 5many steroid injections and nerve ablations to count.  6These real medical procedures were in the same area 7of my back that Mr. Nassar was supposed to be 8treating.  9Because of Mr. Nassar's complete lack of 10empathy and caring for my physical well-being, I 11still feel unworthy of a pain-free life or at least a 12life with minimal pain.  13What I have described is just a brief 14overview of my life.  To give you more context, Your 15Honor, the past year and few months have been the 16most difficult and trying time of my life as the 17sexual abuse resurfaced with even more intensity, and 18I have constantly relived the abuse.  Because of this 19I had to resign from my job as I fell deeper into 20depression and no longer wanted to live.  I was 21diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and 22still suffer from nightmares, intrusive thoughts, 23anxiety, depression, hypervigilance, and much more.  24I spent 30 days in a trauma treatment center as my 2585symptoms could not be controlled with outpatient 1counseling.  After I received the treatment I 2desperately needed I had to move and restart my 3career and whole life from scratch.  4The stress of constantly reliving the years 5have impacted my physical health.  I have stomach 6problems where I can barely eat anything on some 7days.  I have been hospitalized multiple times for 8back and chest pain and I developed a heart 9arrhythmia that has to be surgically corrected.  Even 10though I'm doing much better, I still have days where 11I call my mom crying, have difficulty socializing, 12and lack motivation to do anything.  13Your Honor, may I now address the 14defendant?  15THE COURT\n",

You have been stripped of your 5medical license and soon you will be known by your 6prison number for what I hope to be the maximum 7sentence.  I find this fitting as I was a thing, 8inhuman, or just a number to you.

That you 17weren't seeing the damage, or did you very well know 18that you were hurting people and did not care?  19I heard you say in your previous sentencing 20that you equated your choices to something like 21alcoholism.

      "26 AMof something else.  1The people you did this to are not weak 2people.  They were and still are determined, proven 3mentally strong, and ambitious.  Each one of us had a 4full life ahead of us and we are full of potential 5and possibilities.  6This is one of the things that I find 7unique about this situation.  You were considered the 8best, and as a result of that, everyone that saw you 9had the utmost potential.  They came from loving, 10supporting families that were doing everything in 11their power to support them.  These kids had dreams, 12the means to achieve them, and were fighting tooth 13and nail to reach them.  They were the cream of the 14crop.  What you did altered critical parts of our 15growth into being healthy adults.  What you did has 16made us second-guess our own inner voice, our gut 17reactions, and our ability to have accurate 18perceptions of people.  19You put massive obstacles in between us and 20greater happiness in our lives, having healthy 21romantic relationships, and having trust for others 22who truly want to -- truly want to help us.  You 23hindered the trajectories of our lives that we and 24our parents worked so very hard for and changed the 2591rest of our lives in ways that we're still realizing 1and dealing with every day.  2This is what makes this crime so heinous, 3the cost is so high and the damage is complicated and 4impossible to measure.  5You did this to countless human beings over 6decades.  Most of our victims probably aren't aware 7of everything you did and what you're being held 8accountable for today.  Not many people look up their 9doctors they saw 20 years ago or 15 or 10 or five 10years ago.  I only found out because of a fluke.  I 11often wondered what the number of victims really is.  12The number of people whose lives you 13altered does not stop with the victims.  It has also 14impacted the people closest to us in our lives.  We 15have no choice but to watch them suffer from this 16too.  Our mothers and fathers who wanted the best for 17us, our spouses and partners, our friends, all of us 18with so many people, for what?  19More recently the price that the bravest of 20us had to have paid to get this out in the open.  21They've had to publicly attach you and what you did 22to them to their names.  Every time someone Googles 23them, possibly for the rest of our lives, they will 24see the sickening things we're talking about here 2592today; when they apply for a job, when they go on a 1first date.  They won't be able to be the ones to 2fully make the choice on when to talk to their kids 3about what happened to them.  This terrible part of 4their past is exposed to all.  In spite of this, they 5have spent so much time and energy to get to this day 6and prevent this from happening to others.  The 7strength of character that these people have shown is 8in stark contrast to who you've shown yourself to be.  9To each and every person who has worked to 10get to this day, I sincerely thank you from the 11bottom of my heart.  I also thank everyone who has 12played a supportive role which really does make a 13world of difference.  14I know our fight isn't over.  We're working 15to change the policies that allowed this behavior to 16span decades.  This type of crime is not new and the 17lack of policy to prevent it is inexcusable.  It is 18simply negligence.  If people -- if policy to prevent 19this was in place and was followed, it would have 20prevented this from happening to the majority of us.  21Whistleblowers need to be taken seriously.  Reporting 22needs to be mandatory and documented, and this part 23is not difficult to figure out.  Policymakers have 24the power to prevent this.  They need to know this.  2593I hope that you give Larry Nassar the 1maximum sentencing.  In my mind, this is what the 2maximum number of years was designed for.  Thank you.  3THE COURT\n",

You manipulated me into believing 4that everything you did was okay, that I was supposed 5to trust you, and I was supposed to never question 6anything you did because you were a doctor.  And 7because you were my doctor, you took advantage of me.  8You stripped me of my dignity, my youth, and my 9trust, all for your personal satisfaction.  10Because of your actions my life has forever 11changed.

I was a victim of sexual 13assault by someone I trusted and by someone who was 14supposed to help me achieve my passions in life, but 15instead you physically and emotionally abused me.  I 16have to live with the consequences every single day 17for the rest of my life while you never once thought 18about how your actions would affect the innocent 19women you decided to take advantage of for your 20personal pleasure.  21My childhood has forever been scarred while 22it should have been the happiest of times.

      "  Dear Judge Aquilina, until just 16a few short months ago I vowed to myself at the 17beginning of this nightmare that I would never step 18foot into a courtroom with this man or any part of 19this awful circumstance.  20However, in November when I sat at home 21with my hands shaking while watching the live feed in 22the first hearing you presided over I heard the most 23interesting, powerful words come from your mouth.  24You said that you wanted every girl to heal and you 25103would let us take as long as we needed to all come 1forward and speak out.  That gave me the courage to 2face the fact that I was abused by Larry Nassar at 3the Michigan State University Sports Medicine Clinic 4for many years as I came to him for medical help for 5my gymnastics injuries. 6I decided I wanted to have the courage to 7step forward and fully have this experience today so 8that I could heal and gain freedom and have closure 9from this confusing chapter of my life.  So, first of 10all, I want to thank you for having the foresight and 11the compassion to make this happen for all of us 12today.  13THE COURT\n",
      "  You're welcome.  It's so very 14important that you're here and that your voice be 15heard and it is part of the healing, and I recognize 16that in all cases I allow victims to speak and allow 17the time needed.  You are healing.  You being in this 18courtroom, being able to face the demons, it's so 19important, and I just thank you so much for having 20the strength and courage to be here.  21What else would you like me to know?  22VICTIM 55\n",
      "  For those of you here listening 23today, I am remaining anonymous because that gives me 24the peace of mind that I need right now, but as I 25104stand here before you, Larry Nassar, I know that I am 1not anonymous to you.  You once knew me so well.  You 2knew my voice, my face, my body in ways that you 3should have never been allowed to know.  You knew 4everything about me.  5Up until just a few years ago you were a 6confidant.  You were my close friend who always had 7my best interests in mind, whether it is about my 8injuries, my eating habits, my gymnastics practices, 9school choices, college decisions, career path, and 10all the way up to my family plans.  I know now that 11this is one of the surefire signs of a friendly 12sexual predator.  I know now that the word grooming 13is a bad word, a word that I should never had to 14research as an adult woman.  15When I was young I did not recognize that 16the grooming you were up to for more than a decade 17with me was to manipulate me to allow yourself 18further access to my body, to take advantage of me 19for your own selfish pleasure.  Even though I tried 20to stop you many times, you continually established 21trust with me so you could continue to hurt me.  I 22had no idea that you took my love for gymnastics and 23my desire to stay out of pain and you used it against 24me.  25105I sometimes think if I can tell my younger 1self how much I was loved and valued when I was only 214 and when it all began while receiving treatment 3from Larry Nassar, then maybe I would have never been 4tricked into a friendship and support from a doctor 5that I thought really cared about my well-being with 6all of his heart.  But that is not the case here 7because it wouldn't have mattered in what state of 8confidence I ever was because he was a master at 9manipulating the situation to feed his selfish 10addiction of taking advantage of me any time he 11could.  12I completely trusted him 150 percent.  I 13never questioned why he always asked the nurses or 14residents to leave the room even though he was known 15as a teaching doctor and it would have made much more 16sense for them to stay in the room to learn his 17techniques.  But those techniques were a facade to 18feed his addiction, and because of that, I have dealt 19with questioning every person that I have ever met.  20I questioned that they had true intentions, and I 21never learned to really trust the actual trustworthy 22people in my life.  23I am not confused any longer about his 24intentions.  I now understand that he had a lifetime 2510629 of 57 sheetsPage 107 to 110 of 21702/13/2018 09\n",

      "26 AMcareer of hurting that he disguised as wanting to 1genuinely help.  I might believe that he could have 2had an ounce of good to his soul because I knew him 3so well, but he let his sinful and selfish desires 4take over his soul and his whole existence and he 5fell into the trap of extreme selfishness, not just 6for the hundreds of instances he took advantage of me 7but for so many other gymnasts, women, and girls.  8Although his actions have affected my whole 9life and especially my health and my confidence, I am 10choosing to move forward and choosing to use the 11awful pain of this to grow stronger as a woman and 12daughter of God.  13First Peter 5\n",
      "10 says, And after you have 14suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who 15has called you to his internal glory in Christ, he 16himself will restore, confirm, strengthen, and 17establish you.  18I did, however, deal with a sense of guilt 19only due to the fact that I previously thought that 20if I would have spoken up more or louder then 21somebody would have listened at Michigan State 22University.  But I did tell a coach while on my 23gymnastics team at MSU and Kathie chose to put 24Larry's name, her identity, and the university's 25107reputation above the choice to protect me.  My 1concerns and fears were minimized by those in 2authority positions at MSU, but now I don't have to 3carry that guilt any longer.  I was child.  I did my 4best, and I did speak up.  Even if I said it louder 5or more often, it wouldn't have mattered because we 6can see now that many girls and women spoke to people 7in authority at MSU and they were not heard.  8This is so devastating.  This is a 9miscarriage of justice.  May we all learn from this 10that if a child ever comes to us about any type of 11unusual feeling coming from any adult, we will never 12brush them off.  We will listen to their every word 13and we will show them that we care and that we want 14to help them by taking immediate action for them.  15May our state, our community, and especially our 16university learn from this horrible sequence of 17mistakes that children should be protected always and 18at all costs.  19We have to find the positive.  Larry 20Nassar's actions and MSU's negligence will be the 21reason for a change in a society filled with secrets 22and confusion.  Because of the brave women and girls 23and friends and parents and family members that are 24here today that have stepped forward to bring truth 25108and light to this dark secret, we will now see a 1change.  We will know how to recognize a person of 2extreme status and high caliber can also be one that 3causes extreme hurt and trauma and is utterly 4dangerous with repercussions that last a lifetime.  5I believe the real tragedy here is not just 6that one man was extremely sinful in nature but that 7MSU did not have the proper checks and balances in 8place.  They somehow managed to glorify a criminal 9and ignore the signs.  Instead of private 10investigations, myself and several other girls were 11told by the MSU staff that we were wrong.  We grew up 12watching MSU promote and glorify a child pedophile.  13MSU enabled, paid, and promoted him to live out these 14terrible acts.  We were repeatedly shut down with our 15attempts of stopping this man.  16As I am now a mother, I can say that there 17is absolutely no excuse for this.  Regardless of how 18insignificant a child's plea for help may have seemed 19by MSU, I don't understand how this history could 20have went on for more than two decades.  These are 21the answers that I demand.  This is the change that 22needs to happen right here in our community so that 23growth will happen at other institutions.  If all of 24us survivors' pain and suffering prevents and 25109protects other children, then it will not be wasted.  1I have freedom not to be afraid anymore.  I 2will be free from the chains of control from a man 3that will never have access to me or any girl ever 4again.  And I am free from worrying what will happen 5to Larry Nassar.  His actions have caught up to him 6and God will deal with him now for what he sees best.  7I believe he needs the maximum sentence for 8his actions and so that future predators will 9remember this story and choose to stop violating 10children and get help.  The truth is out and we can 11use this truth to overcome evil and make sure these 12things will never happen again.  13For all of those that covered for him, 14enabled him, or turned the other way while I saw him 15at Michigan State University, I hope your actions 16will come to light and you can come out with the 17truth to make our university and community a safer 18place for children and women.  And if you choose not 19to, I know at some point your actions, too, will 20catch up with you.  Our God is a just God and he will 21bring mercy and healing to all of us that need it.  22With God there's always hope.  23Revelations 21, four through five says, he 24will wipe away every tear from their eyes.

You will be stronger every single day as 13defendant gets weaker, and you can rest assured 14knowing that, and I think your message is especially 15important because if I take your words together, what 16I hear is that you are asking that people, especially 17children, come before sports and that the people, 18especially the children, are not a backseat in sports 19but a front seat consideration before anything else, 20and it shouldn't be just in sports but in all life, 21but, of course, we know here defendant was a sports 22doctor -- I don't want to use the term, I know it 23upsets everyone, he's no longer a doctor but at that 24point.  And this cry that you made for checking on 25111safety is very important.

The recurring times I was just confused and 23assumed it was necessary since he did it with my 24mother in the room, and I just never fully 25113understood.  It wasn't until last year when coming 1home for the holidays and reading the IndyStar 2article that I fully realized what happened.3Through the entire time I was seeing him I 4was told by multiple people in his office and my 5pediatrician's office that he was the best and he 6would be my best shot of not being in pain anymore so 7I assumed from there that anything that happened was 8medically necessary.  9Prior to this time I was a tenaciously 10confident, adventurous, and free-spirited girl who 11thrived in leadership roles on my soccer, cross 12country team, and in choirs and musicals.  I was 13endlessly spending time in my room writing songs.  I 14was overly loving, overly trusting, naive, seeing the 15best in every living thing type of person.  I was 16confident in my abilities and opinions and had big 17plans for my future.  18THE COURT\n",

      "  Unlike most of the women in 6this room who were and are accomplished gymnasts, 7when I was a teenager I was an elite vocalist and I 8would spend most of my time in different choirs, 9ensembles, and musicals, solo competitions, and 10eventually being recruited to sing for Michigan 11State.  One of the biggest things I believe to change 12during this time is I began to become afraid of my 13own ability to write and to perform.  I believe that 14through the confusion and self disgust I felt for 15repeatedly -- from what repeatedly happened to me I 16slowly lost the certainty I had in my ability and my 17passion for being on stage and for writing music.  I 18could no longer handle the vulnerability it took to 19perform on a regular basis.  20By the time I turned 19 the only performing 21I did was bar singing in which I could use alcohol as 22a sedative for my nerves, and I haven't been able to 23finish writing a song since I was 18.  24In addition to taking some of my love of 25115music it is because of Larry and his misuse of trust 1that I stopped playing soccer.  Soccer was always my 2favorite sport and the sport I was most talented in.  3When I began seeing Larry in 2003 he sent 4me to get a bone scan in which he told me it came 5back showing a stress fracture in my lower spine.  I 6was to wear a back brace for much of that year.  He 7used my stress fracture as the reason to tell me I 8needed to continue seeing him, stop playing soccer, 9and that my back was too fragile, and with the right 10slide tackle I would end up paralyzed.  I put full 11trust in him, as you generally would a doctor who was 12told was the best, and stopped playing soccer.  13When getting my medical results for this 14legal process I found the statement no fracture is 15seen in multiple place from other doctors in my 16medical file.  It is incredibly angering to realize 17the sport that I love beyond words was taken from me 18for a reason that I now believe was completely false 19and only used to keep me as a patient for his 20personal gain.  21In addition to not playing soccer 22throughout the last 14 years due to false 23information, I also lived my life more cautiously 24believing that my body was more fragile than it was.  25116Another one of the things that I feel Larry 1has taken from me is my sense of self confidence and 2assurance in my own ability, judgment, and physical 3strength.  I worked hard to accomplish many things 4throughout my life but I've since struggled to be 5proud or share what I accomplished with others.  Not 6only does this hurt me on a personal level but has 7been an issue looking for employment.  I often cower 8to the ideas of male co-workers, especially 9supervisors, or avoid being put in a position where I 10would have to work in close proximity with men, 11sometimes even leaving positions when I feel like it 12is too much.  13Instead of taking opportunities to work 14late, when I often know it would just be me and male 15co-workers in the building, I leave immediately, 16often to the effect of being behind in my work so 17that I am never alone.  This has gotten exponentially 18worse over the last year after reliving everything 19through an adult's eyes.  20For the last 14 years I have struggled with 21trust and intimacy with others.  Generally it takes 22me a long time to fully trust anyone and possibly 23years before I really share anything truly emotional 24and vulnerable about myself, which I used to do 25117regularly and took a lot of pride as an artist to do 1so.  2Physical touch has since been a huge 3problem for me.  I get anxiety before large family 4events and holidays knowing that I will most likely 5be touched and hugged by those I love.  Something 6that should be joyful and relaxing is often anything 7but.  When touched unexpectedly even by those closest 8to me like my husband, my initial reaction is 9defensive and it takes a while for my nervous system 10to calm down.  11In addition to the anxiety being brought on 12by touch, I often feel a lot of guilt and self 13loathing for being so guarded and unloving to those 14closest to me.  In the last year since the news broke 15I had to come to terms with a lot of what exactly 16happened to me 14 years ago, and I lost a lot of 17trust in those around me.  Aside from close friends, 18I've had a year of avoiding conversation, touch, 19sharing what is going on in my life.  I often find 20myself replaying horrible flashbacks in my head 21trying to make sense of it all.  It has caused a lot 22of anxiety, depression, recurrent nightmares, and a 23lack on my personal relationships.  24One of the major issues that has occurred 2511802/13/2018 09\n",
      "13\n",
      "26 AMPage 119 to 122 of 21732 of 57 sheetsrecently is that I have -- I have always had anxiety 1when being around male doctors but it has gotten 2exponentially worse, and as someone who has gone 3through infertility testing and currently pregnant, 4it becomes exhausting to have to constantly advocate 5to have a female doctor and explain why it's 6necessary when somebody doesn't take you seriously.  7If I'm unable to see a female physician, I generally 8have intense anxiety leading up to and during the 9exam.  For example, a couple months ago I had gone in 10for an HSG test and was only able to get a male 11doctor.  They allowed me to have two young techs with 12me at the time, but I had so much anxiety having a 13gynecological procedure done by a male, between that 14and the pain, I passed out on the table almost 15immediately after it started.  My heart rate and 16blood pressure were so low the office had to call my 17husband to come get me.  It is ridiculously 18embarrassing to have to take extreme precaution for 19my medical care.  I generally thrive in high stress 20situations and intentionally work in such, but when 21it comes to my own medical care, the simplest issue 22is paralyzing.  23It has also made the process of making a 24birth plan with my hospital unnecessarily very 25119complicated and I fear what the added anxiety from 1this case and what I live with day-to-day will do to 2my daughter.  3I have also lost a lot of the love I had 4for coming back to my hometown and the passion I 5always held for being a Spartan.  Coming back to East 6Lansing has always been a fun and exciting time for 7me.  I see friends and everything.  And even though 8we live out of state, it was important for my husband 9and I to come back to campus and be married there, 10but it has now turned into reliving what happened to 11me years before the entire time.  I no longer look 12forward to spending my weekends watching sports with 13friends, which has always been a large pastime of 14mine and has been a hobby since I was young 15Overall this trauma has caused me a great 16deal of depression, anxiety, recurrent nightmares, 17intimacy issues, loss of enjoyment in loved 18activities, issues at work, feelings of guilt, shame, 19low self esteem and self worth, and occasional 20suicidal thoughts.  It has caused feelings of guilt 21and depression in my family members, especially my 22mother who knows this has to do with the pain that 23she was in the room at the time, and added 24unnecessary strain on my closest relationships.  25120These things that happened to me in his 1office long ago were not short-lived, uncomfortable 2moments.  They were lifelong traumas that has changed 3the way I walk in the world.  4And if it's okay with you, I'd like to say 5something to Larry.  6THE COURT\n",

To me, it 13sounded like the same manipulative narrative that 14puts you in sympathetic light that has allowed you to 15remain in a powerful position for far too long.

A year of saying the rosary does not 21erase all the evil you have done in my eyes and I 22hope in the state's as well.  This is between you and 23God.  24While you remain on this earth I hope that 25121you are continually reminded of the pain you caused 1all of us as we are constantly reminded in our daily 2interactions of our lives.  We did not get to choose 3this trauma, but you did.  4My hope is that the women here like myself 5do continue to grow and heal and become stronger than 6ever before, but that will be because of our actions 7and our strength, not yours.  I hope to take that 8strength to continue to work with vulnerable 9populations and have something come out of my pain 10so, Your Honor, I ask that you impose the full 125 11year sentence.  I do not believe he should get to 12terrorize the hundred plus girls and get to walk away 13with anything less than a year for each of us.

      "  Okay.  As for the details of 20myencounter with Nassar, unfortunately those are 21more difficult to forget.  22A little history about me.  Though legally 23an adult at 18, I was still very much a kid when I 24came to Michigan State.  I left school, one, having 25125kissed two boys and, two, armed with my dad's 1permission to punch anybody in the nose who tried to 2put his hands where he shouldn't.  3Going in as a freshman I was pretty naive.  4I was desperate to compete and I wanted to get 5better.  I was considered a star player coming out of 6high school and expectations were high for me when I 7first entered the program.  So when my performance 8was not up to par -- I sat on the bench first half of 9the season -- I felt like I was letting my team down 10so I worked harder, practiced more.  Just like 11everyone in this room, you want to get on the floor 12and compete.  13The rigors of training began to take a toll 14on my body and I battled shoulder inflammation along 15with back and leg injuries.  I was highly motivated 16to heal and I wanted nothing more than to compete to 17mypotential for the benefit of my team.  Sports 18medicine was new to me so who was I to question it?  19Growing up in my family you went to the doctor if, 20one, you were dying, two, you broke a bone, or, 21three, you were due for a checkup.  Other than my 22high school athletic trainer who occasionally iced 23and taped up my ankle, my experience with sports 24medicine doctors was obsolete at best.  We treated 2512602/13/2018 09\n",
      "13\n",
      "26 AMPage 127 to 130 of 21734 of 57 sheetsour sprained ankles, jammed fingers, and pulled 1muscles at home.  Coming under the care of sports 2medicine doctors was a new experience for me.  I was 3absolutely blown away by the program and how well 4they took care of their student athletes.  5So here are the details of the incident as 6I remember them.  7To the MSU volleyball team Doctor Nassar 8was jokingly referred to as the crouch doc for his 9unconventional methods of treating back and hip pain.  10The buzz around Jenison Fieldhouse is that he was 11somewhat of a wizard, a nationally recognized doctor 12with great success in his field of expertise.  It 13seemed like the doctors at MSU were always in demand, 14especially Doctor Brumm and Doctor Nassar, so when I 15was squeezed in to see the doctor with the miracle 16treatments, I was very grateful.  Again, this was 17back when Jenison had medical trailers for a brief 18time because our training room didn't have adequate 19private space for doctors visits.  I remember having 20the option of keeping my Spandex on, which I was very 21grateful for and chose.  He had me lay down face down 22on the medical table.  When he started treatment I 23remember him saying his treatment relied upon 24applying pressure to areas around the pelvis and that 25127this was normal, so when he went down there I just 1told myself it was normal, that he knows what he's 2doing, and don't be a baby.  3I remember he first started with 4pressure -- excuse me.  Excuse me.  He first started 5with pressure points around the outside of my vagina 6and around my pubic bones.  He said he was trying to 7relieve pressure and something about nerve endings in 8that area being related to the back.  He would just 9ask me questions and talk about life, his work, and 10how he used this method to help some.  However, 11during the procedure I am now choosing to report, he 12just gradually moved in, pressing through and 13stretching my Spandex with his fingers as he entered 14through my vaginal opening.  I remember laying there 15wondering, is this okay?  This doesn't seem right.  16Should I say something?  What's happening?  I didn't 17know what to do.  He just kept on talking about life 18like when you go to the dentist and they talk about 19random stuff to try to make you feel at ease.  He 20didn't say anything out of the ordinary, he just did 21it as though he was doing something as mindless as 22riding a bicycle.  23There are two arguments at war in my mind, 24this doesn't seem right versus he's a world-renowned 25128doctor and he's treated so many athletes.  Everyone 1knows he treats down there and they don't complain so 2just stop being a baby.  Everyone trusted him.  I 3told myself I needed to trust him, too, so I 4convinced myself it was just a normal part of the 5procedure and kept my mouth shut.  However, I could 6not have prepared myself for what happened next.  7Originally I was very hesitant to share the 8details of this part.  I did not want to give Nassar 9or any other sexual predator the opportunity to 10relive any details but I think this is a huge problem 11in society today that there are people that are 12hesitant to speak up because they think a victim 13wanted to be assaulted.  And that's just not true.  14So in my opinion this is the worst part15Again, growing up in a culture with little 16experience of my own, I assumed something like what 17happened to me would only happen if I wanted it to.  18Now that I'm a grown woman with friends in the 19medical field, I know this is not true at all from a 20medical standpoint, but what I knew at the time was 21based on magazines, movies, culture, and other teens 22just joking about it.  To be clear, during that 23appointment Nassar put direct pressure on places I 24didn't know existed at the time and my body reacted.  25129I didn't want it to but it reacted anyways, and as it 1was happening I remember laying there frozen stiff on 2the table utterly mortified, confused, and scared.  I 3felt so powerless to control what was happening.  My 4mind was willing one thing, for it to stop, and my 5body was doing another thing, not stopping.  And all 6the time I had no idea whether or not he was aware of 7what was happening.  He just kept on with his 8treatment as if nothing had happened.  9I didn't move until the treatment was over 10and then I tried my best to pretend nothing happened 11and left as quickly as I could.  12The initial aftermath.  In the aftermath 13questions raced through my mind a mile a minute 14trying to make sense of it all.  What just happened?  15Trying to desperately understand why I couldn't 16control what was happening to my body.  Could my body 17really react that way if I didn't want it to?  I 18thought that was impossible, but clearly it wasn't 19because it just happened.  If it's not supposed to 20happen like that, what does that say about me?  Was I 21sick or something?  Did I need help?  I felt like my 22body had just betrayed me, and I had built up such a 23wall of protection in my mind around Nassar that my 24first reaction was to question myself, to blame 2513035 of 57 sheetsPage 131 to 134 of 21702/13/2018 09\n",

      "26 AMmyself.  I wanted to believe the best in people, but 1no matter how much I rationalized, he's a doctor, 2he's trying to help you, you should be grateful he's 3treating you, he didn't mean for it to happen, I 4couldn't shake the voice in my head that said 5something wasn't right.  6But how could I tell someone?  I was so 7afraid if I told someone the truth that they would 8think I was lying, that they would think I was one of 9those athletes just looking to stir up trouble.  I 10was scared they would draw their own conclusions, 11they would believe the only way for my body to react 12in that manner was if I liked it, if I welcomed it, 13or if I wanted it.  I knew -- I was afraid that 14people would look at me differently.  I was fearful 15of being looked down upon, of being labeled.  I was 16fearful a man wouldn't want me after that.  That no 17man would want me.  People would think I was messed 18up.  I would be deemed unlovable, unacceptable, and 19what if what Doctor Nassar did was unintentional?  20What if my body was just abnormal?  Again, I was 21young, inexperienced, and I didn't know there was a 22spot inside your body that triggered that type of 23response.  I feared the possibility of accusing an 24innocent man, that I could ruin a good doctor's 25131reputation and career for performing a normal medical 1procedure.  He couldn't control how my body reacted, 2or could he?  3Could what happen be some abnormal freakish 4side effect or something?  But what if it wasn't?  It 5was all so confusing, but in the end I decided to go 6to my trainer, Lianna, or Lili as we affectionately 7called her, and ask if there was a way for athletes 8to file a general complaint just stating that they 9were uncomfortable with their doctor's visit.  Again, 10all I wanted to do was say I'm uncomfortable and to 11have that heard and recorded with the small hope that 12I wasn't alone.  13So when I came to her asking her if I could 14file a general complaint, she treated the situation 15with both seriousness and sober-mindedness and tried 16to walk me through the process the best way that she 17knew how.  She asked me all sorts of questions, did 18Nassar do something you thought was criminally wrong?  19Did he hurt you?  I remember trying to answer as 20truthfully as possible, but I was so scared of 21revealing what I thought were shameful details that I 22didn't give her much to go on.  23In the end, she wanted to make sure I 24correctly understood what filing a report would 25132involve; an investigation, making an accusation 1against Nassar, and stating that I felt that he did 2something unprofessional or criminally wrong.  At the 3time I couldn't say I -- could I say that with 4certainty?  I had a hard time saying that with 5certainty.  I just wanted to say I was uncomfortable 6and have it recorded.  I wasn't aware of a way to do 7that without making a formal accusation and exposing 8those mortifying details to the world, so instead of 9filing a report, I came up with a plan for the 10future.  If I ever had to be treated by the doctor 11again, I would be forthright and clear.  If he tried 12to go there, I would speak up.  I would say I was 13uncomfortable, and I resolved in my mind if he 14proceeded to cross a boundary after that, I would 15drop kick him in the face.  Armed with this initial 16resolution, it just felt safer to move on.  17I'm sorry, I'm breaking from this for a 18minute.  19And then you come in here and you see all 20these beautiful, young women, these little girls -- 21I'll get to that later.  Just stick with it.  Go.  22Okay.  23So why am I now choosing to report this?  I 24didn't hear about the accusations against Doctor 25133Nassar until the day after my birthday, which was 1April 7th of 2000 -- what was last year?  2MR. BEDFORD\n",

      "  Thank you.  When I first 4heard about it my initial instinct was to send a 5group chat to my teammates.  I knew some had been 6treated by him, and I wanted to make sure no one was 7as oblivious as I was.  It sparked a conversation and 8I found myself once again faced with a decision to 9speak up.  Memories began to resurface and I found 10myself having to revisit the scenario once more again 11under different circumstances.  12With a sexual experience of a woman married 13nearly 12 years and armed with the realization far 14more athletes had similar experiences to my own, I 15now find it very hard to believe that Doctor Nassar, 16as a recognized medical professional, did not know 17those spots were there and that he was unaware of the 18changes that were happening to me when I was lying 19face down on that medical table, so I called my 20church mentor, a physical therapist at Botsford 21Hospital in Metro Detroit, and through uncontrollable 22sobbing I began to painfully unearth and recollect 23the incident I had so decidedly buried years ago.  24She was the first person I ever told.

      "26 AMPage 135 to 138 of 21736 of 57 sheetsarmed with the knowledge I was not alone, I could 1barely muster enough courage to share the details of 2myencounter with Nassar.  3Gradually over the period of a few days I 4faced my fear, opened up to select friends, family, 5and my team about the incident.  The love and support 6I received from them has been overwhelming, 7especially from my husband who's been an 8un-formidable rock of protection, love, and 9understanding through this process.  If I were to put 10someone else in my shoes, I feel like I could easily 11understand her situation, her emotions, and 12reluctance to speak up, but it's a little bit more 13difficult when you're the one in those shoes.  14The past few weeks -- so this is when I 15initially made my report in May, so during that time 16period and since it's been a roller coaster of 17emotions.  I constantly ask myself, did I have the 18power to stop him?  Did I have the power?  Could my 19voice have been the one that broke the chain of abuse 20and stopped him in his tracks?  Even now speaking the 21truth is, admittedly, difficult.  It's vulnerable.  22It's risky.  People might still arrive at their own 23misguided conclusions, and I'm powerless to stop it.  24However, I'm convinced it's the right thing to do.  25135Even though my case may be 101 out of a 1hundred similar cases, I want to stand with all women 2who came forward before me and after me if just to 3say you're not alone.  And speaking up for my loved 4ones, my nieces, my nephews, my family, brothers, 5sisters, friends, I pray they would never find 6themselves in similar circumstances, but should that 7day come, I want them to be courageous, truthful, and 8to speak up without shame.  I am speaking simply to 9stand for truth and to face fear and to refuse to 10give fear a foothold any longer.  11Since I gave my initial statement to Doctor 12Munford -- Doctor Munford -- detective -- got you.13DETECTIVE MUNFORD\n",

      "  Getting all of this on paper 15and preparing for this has been no small feat.  The 16amount of energy and emotional toll required to 17process and digest all of it has been completely 18draining.  I agonized for hours whether or not to 19speak in person, processing the potential 20repercussions and how my actions and decisions to 21speak up would affect loved ones around me, the 22opinions people have of me.  I wish I could say this 23was it, that this crime would no longer affect me or 24myloved ones, that I could forgive once, find 25136closure, and simply move on, I just want it to be 1over, but, unfortunately, it's not that easy.  2The truth is that once the gavel comes down 3and the sentence is revealed, for me the battle is 4not over.  Memories remain and a sense of uneasiness 5and uncertainty has been created from the choice to 6come forward, to stand, and to be counted.  How does 7one gain victory over memories?  You can battle 8memories but you can't erase them.  We try to keep 9them at arm's length, stop, locked someplace outside 10the boundary of our daily lives.  However, despite 11all our effort to squelch, bury, and forget, those 12memories remain and they find a way to invade at the 13most inopportune times.  They have no scruples, no 14manners, or decorum.  All it takes is one trigger to 15unlock the door and those memories rush in like a 16flood.  Sometimes during even our most private and 17intimate moments they rush in unwelcomed with the 18ability to make us feel just as ashamed, just as 19embarrassed, small, and powerless as we felt when the 20incident first happened.  21While I have hope to find peace and gain 22quicker victory over the emotions that accompany 23those memories, fighting to remain at a place of 24peace will be a battle I fight for the rest of my 25137life.  Memories like that try to accuse you at every 1opportunity.  2During this season of life, this is my 3reality.  By making a decision to speak I must not 4only face the memories of those events but unearth, 5revisit, and reassess all the details I so decidedly 6buried years ago.  There were things I didn't 7understand and things I made excuses for, because, 8quite frankly, I was afraid.  And processing it all 9has been both painful, damaging, liberating, and 10terrifying all at once.  11For the longest time my story was hidden.  12No one could hurt or judge because no one knew.  Now 13it feels -- well, not feels, everyone knows.  Try to 14imagine yourself stripped naked, exposed to the world 15standing in a room filled with people examining you, 16judging you.  I kept my secret away for years because 17of fear.  I imagined the worst thing that could 18happen and the risk felt too great.  19I'm still convinced my decision to stand 20for truth, to silence shame, and to be counted is the 21right thing to do, but I didn't anticipate -- what I 22didn't anticipate was that this resolve to stand for 23truth would be challenged in my own mind every single 24time I chose to share my story.

      "26 AMto others, it's not without risk.  You hear it over 1and over.  It's a safe place.  Safe?  You want to 2believe that.  But no matter which way you slice it, 3you're still standing there naked in the middle of a 4room vulnerable revealing some painful details to 5people, people who have both the power to heal and 6hurt, restore and ostracize, support and reject, or 7bully and blame, and you're powerless to control 8their reactions.  Simply observe children out on a 9playground and you'll learn very quickly human beings 10do not need a reason to be unkind.  11So if history dictates that a storm might 12be coming and that people could be both unkind 13towards you and towards the loved ones that stand up 14for you, you brace for impact, and this is the 15tumultuous aftermath.  It is paranoia and the fear of 16not being accepted.  It's dealing with the swirling, 17raging, chaotic storm of thoughts and fears that 18accompany one's choice to be vulnerable and being 19forced to face the uncertainty that comes from an 20unavoidable reality.  What was hidden is no longer 21hidden, and because of that, circumstances in your 22life could be different than they were before.  23I didn't anticipate that I would 24second-guess myself, that I would second-guess my 25139relationships, and even the thoughts of those closest 1to me.  I found -- it's not difficult to imagine what 2people are thinking.  Granted, saying, hey, I know 3what you must think before people have had a chance 4to express their opinion isn't exactly fair, but it's 5not difficult for my train of thought to go down that 6track.  7As a result of what's happened with Doctor 8Nassar I need to fight harder to trust those close to 9me and equally hard to make insignificant the 10opinions of those that would come against the truth 11of who I am.  12And that's a whole separate level, my own 13thoughts towards myself.  You're faced with the 14realization that you could have said something and 15didn't because you were afraid, ignorant athletes.  16We're supposed to be brave.  We're supposed to be 17strong.  But you were a coward.  Your dad is a police 18officer, you should have known better.  You made the 19wrong choice.  You see, it's not that difficult for 20our own hearts to condemn us either.  I have battled 21guilt of not speaking up.  I questioned my ability to 22make sound decisions, and I needed to face the truth 23that, yes, I was scared.  But I was recently reminded 24by a friend of a passage I love in my bible.  It's 1 25140John, 3\n",
      "18 through 20, that says, Little children, 1let us not love in word and speech but in action and 2truth and by this we will know that we belong to the 3truth and will assure our hearts in his presence.  4Even if our hearts condemn us, God is greater than 5our hearts.  He knows all things.  6So my conclusion, I'm still searching for 7healing, for wholeness.  I know it's there for me but 8at this point in time I can't see it fully, but I'm 9battling for it.  Every person who has come forward 10must find their own way to stand under the weight of 11it all.  As an athlete, I was trained to battle, to 12be a warrior, to fight and overcome, so for me in my 13mind I find myself engaged in an all-out war against 14any accusation that might come against the truth of 15who I know myself to be.  16As a Christian I have every reason to hope, 17yet right now I'm fighting to believe that.  When my 18heart condemns on every side, when that train of 19thought starts barreling down the tracks a hundred 20miles an hour with no sign of stopping, what's left 21to me is to step out in front of that train, root, 22ground myself in the truth of who I am, and stand 23firm in that foundation and push back.  24I am loveable.  I am wanted.  I am 25141significant.  I am accepted.  I am valuable.  I was 1made to love God and love people without fear.  2Depression is not my portion but joy and hope are my 3portion.  4The road to healing looks steep from where 5I am standing now, but I am a warrior.  There are 6unformidable truths that God says about me that no 7man can steal or spoil, so I arm myself with these 8truths.  They're a sword in my arsenal and I know the 9end of the story for me.  I will win, but I'm 10still -- right now I'm still in the fight.  11As for the sentencing, I feel I can trust 12the judgment and decision of the court after hearing 13all of these testimonies that have come before you.  14May I address Doctor Nassar, please?  15THE COURT\n",

      "  Thank you.  As for 17forgiveness, Doctor Nassar, I want you to know that I 18pray for you and I do forgive you.  Is there still 19hurt?  Absolutely.  It's a part of processing.  But 20please know my forgiveness towards you is sincere.  21What good would it be to hold on to bitterness and 22anger, especially in light of such great forgiveness 23that's been granted to me that I should be called a 24child of God.  2514202/13/2018 09\n",

If Paul the 6apostle could find it, you can find it.  It's 7beautiful and it's worth living for, and I believe 8that what you've done, those choices you made, is not 9who God intended for you to be when he chose to bring 10you into this world.  You can choose to be a better 11man and to be a different person, and I really do 12pray and hope that you seek -- seek him and find 13that.  Thank you.  14THE COURT\n",
      "  Thank you.  Thank you for your 15words.  I thought they were powerful, and a couple 16things I loved about what you said is that you said 17some positive things about yourself, and that's 18really helpful to the other survivors.  19You are courageous.  You are truthful, and 20you recognize, especially as an athlete -- we found 21now gymnastics, soccer, this is now extended into 22volley ball, and as athletes you all know the saying 23no pain, no gain.  This case certainly sheds a whole 24new light on that saying, in my mind.  25143You all have to go through the fire of this 1pain, but there will be tremendous gain, not just for 2you but for countless others who are in the same 3situation or who may be in the same situation in the 4future.  5What you've expressed, your thinking, how 6you were thinking that you didn't really voice it 7because you were so young will remind young people to 8ask those questions, is this okay, this doesn't feel 9right, why doesn't it feel right, let me talk to 10someone, to have that voice beyond inside of their 11head to ask an adult who hopefully is a different 12trusted adult, because those questions are important 13and those voices should come out and there should be 14somebody always available to listen.15And you talked about blame.  Blame is an 16epidemic in these cases that has to stop, and your 17words can help stop the blame, because victims should 18never, ever be blamed, and it's that fear that 19stopped you from asking those questions, and all of 20you who are coming forward hopefully have that fear 21along with others, ask those all important questions, 22and maybe teachers to talk to students, parents to 23talk to their children about if it doesn't feel 24right.  25144We've all read those articles but many 1people don't voice it, and you have voiced it here 2today.  You have a very powerful voice.  3And you talked about your instinct.  Your 4instinct was to drop kick him in the face.5MS. BEDFORD\n",

There was a crime against you 11and you were just too respectful of trusted adults, 12which he was and should not have been given that 13respect, but you didn't know better, but now others 14may very well listen to that word as well, that 15sentence to drop kick him in the face.  If somebody 16does you wrong, go ahead.  Self defense is a defense.  17I'm proud of you, ma'am.  You are strong.  18You will be healed.

      "  When given the opportunity to 13speak in front of this courtroom I was at first 14hesitant.  I wondered how this might affect my 15future, my career, the loved ones in my life.  I took 16a step back and realized that, once again, I was 17letting the fear, the shame, and the guilt own me.  18I decided it was time to stand up to Larry 19Nassar and to those that enabled him to continue down 20this ravaging path of sexual abuse.  Today I am here 21for me and to be an advocate for the women and young 22girls whose voices have been silenced for so many 23years.  24I remember the first time Larry Nassar 2514639 of 57 sheetsPage 147 to 150 of 21702/13/2018 09\n",
      "13\n",
      "26 AMsexually assaulted me.  It is not something easily 1forgotten, the intense sense of terror, anxiety, and 2disbelief came washing over me.  I lay there in pain 3unable to speak, staring blankly at the wall, 4desperately searching for a way to escape.  5I kept repeating in my head, this is a 6mistake, this isn't real.  I thought, he's a famous 7doctor, there's no way he would do something 8inappropriate in front of my mom.  Well, I was wrong.  9He used his power and position in society to earn our 10trust so that he could use us for his own sexual 11pleasure and gratification.  12These, quote, treatments happened over and 13over again, eating away at my innocence as a child.  14I was just a young girl with big dreams.  Aspiring to 15be the best figure skater I could be.  This is what I 16received in return for my dedication to the sport.  A 17sport that I loved so much, tarnished with vile 18memories.  I'm not sure I could even ever look at 19figure skating the same again, which is a shame 20because the sport essentially defined who I was as a 21child.  22I have always struggled with intimacy in 23relationships because of what Larry Nassar did to me.  24I have vivid flashbacks of him assaulting me.  25147Sometimes I can't even tolerate another person 1touching me in an intimate situation without feeling 2physical pain and experiencing these visual 3flashbacks.  I'm in the room again, on that table, 4reliving these events to this day.  5I feel disgusting.  I find it hard to trust 6not only those I have been in intimate relationships 7with, but also those in positions of power.  I wonder 8who might betray me next?  Because if he could pull 9this off, then who's to stop anyone else from hurting 10me, too.  11I have poor self-esteem and I experience 12frequent episodes of anxiety and depression.  When I 13see someone that looks or sounds like him, my heart 14races, just like it does before I have one of my 15beloved panic attacks.  Sometimes I feel a sense of 16guilt because somehow I wonder if it was my fault 17that all of this happened?  18Relationships with my family members have 19suffered especially since all of this has become 20public.  The nightmares about what he's done have 21haunted me night after night.  22As I sat down to write a statement, I asked 23myself, how can I put this horrific experience into 24words?  There are no words for this.  25148Despite these unfortunate events, I wanted 1to be clear that I will continue to overcome this.  I 2will grow as a person.  I will succeed in my career, 3and my family will flourish because his facade has 4been broken.  I am in charge now.  5It has been hard accepting what Larry 6Nassar did to me.  I'm angry and I'm sad, but I will 7not be silenced anymore.  I encourage the court to 8enforce a minimum sentence of 40 years up to the 9maximum allowable sentence in prison.  It is 10imperative to show our society that sexual abuse will 11not be tolerated, and that we value the importance of 12bringing proper justice to those who have suffered by 13the actions of others.  14But we cannot stop here.  Those who have 15enabled Larry Nassar in his general and high 16lifestyle need to answer to us as well.  Michigan 17State University must take accountability for their 18absence in putting an end to this abuse scandal.  19MSU recently stated that no one affiliated 20with their university, quote, believed that Nassar 21sexually abused anyone until the news articles in 222016.  Well, there's a difference between not 23believing and something seeming unbelievable.  Either 24way, they had the knowledge of the abuse, and their 25149duty was to report it and take action.  If this had 1been appropriately addressed, I wouldn't be here 2talking to you today.  3Something has gone severely wrong at MSU.  4They have ignored us and their lack of action shows 5us that they stand behind a serial sexual abuser.  I 6had higher expectations for my alma mater.  7Until then, we will do our best to heal, 8but I'm afraid for the safety of future students and 9athletes if MSU does not take ownership in their part 10to this story.  11I hope today shed some light into the 12darkness that I have lived through, and I hope to 13give hope to those who have been through the same.  I 14am strong, and together we are even stronger.  Thank 15you.  16THE COURT\n",

      "  Thank you, Your Honor, for 22allowing me to speak today.  23My name is Ashley Erickson.  I am a former 24gymnast and competitive cheerleader.  I was a patient 25152of Doctor Nassar from 1999 through August of 2016.  1Today I can say that I am finally ready to 2face you.  Rather than someone that I used to trust, 3I am looking at a monster that took advantage of me.  4I have a question for you.  Why?  Why did 5you feel that you could do this to us, and not only 6get away with it, but you also felt that you were 7allowed to?  You were the adult.  You were the 8doctor.  9You were also someone that many people told 10me could fix my medical problems.  Instead, you 11groomed us into believing that you cared about us, 12but really you were just fixing your sick thoughts 13and fantasies.  14I remember even lying to you at times 15saying I wasn't in too much pain just because I 16didn't want you to do the procedure.  I didn't know 17why I was asking this or lying to you.  I just knew 18something wasn't right.  You were truly sick.  19I am coming forward so you can no longer 20hurt anyone else and take things away that you took 21away from me.  22Ever since I realized what you were 23actually doing to me, it has been hell.  I have put 24my family and friends through hell.  I've also lost 25153jobs because of how much you have affected me and put 1me through.  I have to rethink everything.  I have no 2trust left for anyone because you took that away.  3How do I ever trust meeting new people after learning 4that someone I trusted for years has betrayed me and 5also took advantage of me?  So why on earth would I 6ever trust anyone again?  7I try every day to overcome this, but every 8day is still a struggle.  More importantly, though, 9it's what this has done to my family.  We have to 10work on our relationships every day because now I 11tend to be so distant and push them away.  I would 12have never done this before.  But now I have, 13unfortunately, became really good at it because I 14still don't want to face what you have done to me and 15how much it affects me daily, so therefore it's just 16easier to be by myself.  17I truly hope with all of us coming forward 18and finally saying what we need to say to you makes 19you realize what you have done.  I hope you think 20about it every day just like I do.  I want this all 21to go away.  I want the nightmares of you coming into 22my room to go away.  I want to be able to go out in 23public without seeing someone that looks like you and 24get so afraid that I have to suddenly leave.  I want 2515441 of 57 sheetsPage 155 to 158 of 21702/13/2018 09\n",

I truly just want to live again 8without the fear of you in my life.  9Finally, Larry, I will no longer let you 10define who I am or who I will be.  I will be strong 11again.  Thank you.  12THE COURT\n",
      "  Thank you.  Ma'am, I think 13every single victim here and in every similar case I 14have ever had has asked why.  It's really the 15unanswerable question.  This defendant is ill.  He's 16never probably going to understand or acknowledge 17exactly what he did and the ramifications, the 18vastness of the destruction that he caused each of 19you.  The only thing I can do is to do what you've 20all asked me to do and to sentence him accordingly, 21which I will do.  22The monster who took advantage of you is 23going to wither much like the scene in the Wizard of 24Oz where the water gets poured on the witch and the 25155witch withers away.

      "  Okay.  So excuse me if I 11stumble my words a little bit.  Just going to speak 12from my heart, like you said. 13In 1997 I saw Doctor Nassar.  I was a 14gymnast, competitive gymnast, and really dedicated to 15the sport.  I spent a lot of time in the gym, had a 16lot of injuries.  This one year -- this one month in 17'97 we were at a competition and I ended up 18fracturing and dislocating my coccyx bone, my 19tailbone, and went over to see him the following day, 20and I had seen him before for, like, some wrist-type 21injuries, things like that.  And I went over to the 22table, and my mother was in the room, and he 23explained that due to the injury, which he had an 24x-ray, he did show us the coccyx bone was dislocated 25157and fractured --1THE COURT\n",

So she was in the room.  5He explained, I'm going to need to have you take off 6your pants and lay face down and I will have to 7massage the muscles with my fingers, and he said, I 8will have to go up anally and massage those muscles 9to loosen them before I move the bone back in place, 10so I laid down, and my mother was aware, and he 11instead inserted his fingers into my vagina, and 12because of me being 12, I didn't know -- I really 13didn't even know the difference, honestly, if it was 14my vagina or what.  I didn't know.  But I just 15remember being in so much pain, tears streaming down 16my face, holding on to the table just shaking, and I 17felt like I didn't -- I didn't know what to do.  18My mother and him were having a 19conversation this whole time just about whatever, 20life, and it seemed like forever, went on forever, 21and finally he pulled his hand out anally and then 22inserted them vaginally, and that's when I knew there 23was a difference at that point and that he had his 24fingers in both places. 2515802/13/2018 09\n",

      "  I don't remember.  4But then he popped the bone back into 5place.  I went to school.  He said, come back and see 6me in two weeks and we'll make sure it's final.  I 7went back to see him a couple weeks later, feeling 8better, and he says -- we didn't do an x-ray, didn't 9do any x-ray -- he said, it's out of place, again I 10need to redo the procedure, and I remember just being 11completely scared.  You know, I didn't want to go 12through that again.  I did not want to go through 13that.  But I went through it again, and the same 14thing, the tears coming down, almost kind of, just in 15the middle of it, I don't want to say blacked out but 16was, like, out of body almost, just numb, blank stare 17kind of, didn't know what to do.  My mom was, once 18again, in the room.  19And on the way home I told her what 20happened and she was livid.  She was so furious.  I 21remember her saying, what?  He did what?  He didn't 22tell me he was going to do that.  He just said he 23needed to anally massage the muscles.  He didn't tell 24me he was going to go up the other way, and at that 25159point I was scared.  I didn't know what to think.  1Being a 12 year old you kind of just trust the 2doctor.  Like, you know, all the other women were 3saying, you just believe that he's doing what's best 4for you, what's right for you.  Being that young, 5just trust, and he was very well respected and 6everybody talked so highly of him, so back in the gym 7I remember people whispering about what had happened 8because at that point it went around to everyone.  9All the parents were talking, coaches were talking 10about it, and I felt really alone, just -- I didn't 11know what to think or do, really.  Just very alone.  12THE COURT\n",

The 18coaches, I think that was -- I know they're probably 19listening and watching -- the people that I was most 20disappointed in because they were supposed to protect 21us and they just decided that it was more important 22to have functioning athletes and the reputation was 23more important than our well-being and how we felt, 24so, you know, really that was the thing that really 25160broke my heart was that they let -- they let me down, 1and I want to say this, because I think in all sports 2now, especially with this happening, I think it's 3important that coaches really try to be there for the 4athletes and not think about the sport and the 5competition and that notoriety of how great they are 6over the fact that they're working with children, 7they're coaching children, they're leaving their 8children in care of somebody like Larry and they're 9just brushing it all aside, and I don't want that to 10ever happen to anybody else.  11So, you know, this happened when I was 12.  12I'm now 33.  And I have four kids of my own, and I've 13had so much depression over my life, over the years, 14I think that was my biggest struggle, severe 15depression.  I've been having trouble sleeping, 16trouble with relationships, trouble keeping jobs.  I 17mean, everybody's story that I listened to, it's just 18an echo of everything that I have went through.  19They're just speaking like it's my voice, so I 20just -- it's just really surreal, actually, being in 21this situation right now.  Never imagined I would be 22here.  I heard about this last minute and I really 23couldn't sit down and write.  I said, I just have to 24go up there and say what happened and speak my truth, 25161so I'm trying to think if there's anything else that 1I need to pinpoint right now.  2I just want other girls to be safe -- other 3people, not just girls, other athletes, even boys to 4be safe from sexual predators from this kind of 5abuse, and, oh, I do forgive you, too, Larry.  I 6believe in forgiveness.  I'm not going to carry that 7for the rest of my life.  I'm not.  I have important 8things to do as a mom.  I have some really great 9people in my life.  My dad is here to support me 10today.  And I just wanted to speak -- just say this 11finally, just really get it off my chest and put it 12out there, and hopefully it will help other people do 13the same in situations.  14THE COURT\n",

      "  Thank you kindly for the 24opportunity to address this court.  25164Like all of the brave women who have stood 1before you today, I juggle many roles in life.  I am 2many things.  I am a mother of a beautiful two year 3old daughter.  I have been an attorney for over a 4decade.  I am someone's partner, someone's sister, 5someone's friend, someone's neighbor.  And I am a 6survivor of childhood sexual abuse of the man who 7sits before me today, Larry Nassar.  8Larry, it has been many, many moons since 9our paths last crossed.  I stand here today as what I 10understand to be one of the earliest reported cases 11of sexual abuse at your hands.  I think it is 12important to what I want to say to you today to start 13from the beginning.  14Something I never realized about you is 15that your relationship with the sport of gymnastics, 16and thus little girls in leotards, started in your 17high school years when you worked as an athletic 18trainer starting in 1981 for which you somehow earned 19a varsity letter in women's gymnastics, thanks to 20your work with the team.  21Seven years later in 1988 your relationship 22with the sport of gymnastics and little girls in 23leotards would continue.  This time in the greater 24Lansing area at Great Lakes Gymnastics Club.  25165You were three years out of college.  I was 1eight years old.  As our volunteer athletic trainer 2at Great Lakes you practically lived in the gym.  You 3were there almost every single day for hours with 4your big black medical bag full of supplies over your 5shoulder.  You arrived to the gym early to tape our 6ankles and shin splints and stayed late to tend to 7the rips on our hands and our pulled muscles.  I 8general -- it genuinely seemed as if you had a 9tireless passion for your work, for the sport, and, 10in turn, for us.  11You were not yet the famous Olympic doctor.  12You were not a doctor at all.  You hadn't started 13medical school at Michigan State University.  You 14weren't married to Steph.  I hadn't been a guest at 15your wedding nor danced at your reception yet.  You 16were not a father to three children, two of them 17little girls.  So who were you back then?  You were a 18young man with his whole future ahead of him, a 19future that seemed to be full of nothing but promise 20and passion.  You were the man who was loved and 21trusted by dozens and dozens of us little girls and 22our families.  23You quickly became a fixture at the gym, 24everyone's favorite.  You were the good cop to coach 2516602/13/2018 09\n",

      "26 AMPage 167 to 170 of 21744 of 57 sheetsJohn Geddert's bad cop.  When he broke us mentally 1and physically, depriving us of water on a hot 2summer's day in the un-air conditioned gym or pushing 3us to practice on broken bones, you were the one who 4stepped in.  You defended us.  You stood up to him on 5our behaves.  You protected our bodies from further 6pain.  You literally and metaphorically put us back 7together.  8It seemed as if we were a little family 9back then.  In hindsight, a readily dysfunctional one 10all in a sense growing up together.  You, John, 11Kathie Klages, and that first generation of gymnasts 12known as the originals.  13We were all armed with nothing but dreams.  14John dreamed of getting a girl to the Olympics at any 15cost.  You dreamed of becoming a sports medicine 16doctor.  And I with mediocre gymnastics ability 17dreamed of going away to college, getting married, 18having a family.  And I also dreamed of becoming a 19sports medicine doctor because that was your dream 20and I wanted to be just like you.  21Those early years in the gym were brutal, 22as I know you must remember.  John was young and 23pushed all boundaries.  He was boss.  The enforcer.  24The screamer.  The thrower.  The perfectionist.  The 25167one from whom we desperately sought approval or even 1just some small sign that he actually cared for us 2and not just for winning3You, Larry, were the gentle one, the 4nurturer who always had a smile, a hug, a kind word.  5You earned our trust.  You earned my trust.  But, 6more importantly, as I was just a little girl, you 7earned my mother's trust.  You treated us like 8family.  You attended each of my doctors' 9appointments.  You sat with my mother during my 10surgeries.  We were guests at your wedding.  And yet 11at some point you began pushing boundaries in your 12own terribly, terribly troubled way.  13None of us will ever, ever, ever know when 14or where you started abusing children.  Was that 15always your plan when you found yourself attracted to 16the sport of gymnastics as early as high school?  Had 17you abused anyone before then?  Was the good guy 18persona just an act?  Were you building our trust for 19a reason?  So that you could perpetrate and penetrate 20later on?  And, most importantly, who was that first 21girl?  Am I her?  Do you even remember?  Do you even 22remember what we will never forget?  Can you even 23remember, Larry, when it all began?  24Was there any traceable, albeit faint, 25168voice of conscious within you back then saying, don't 1do it?  Do you remember how you justified it to 2yourself that first time?  I am sure I will never 3know the answers to my questions, but what I do know 4is that I laid alone naked in your apartment in 1992, 5me, 12 years old, you 28 years old, while you 6massaged my tiny body, touching my clitoris and 7penetrating my formerly un-penetrated self.  8By this time you were in medical school at 9the Michigan State University College of Osteopathic 10Medicine.  You had called my home and asked me to 11come to your apartment where you once lived -- where 12you lived alone because you were conducting a study 13on flexibility on behalf of the medical college and 14you needed subjects for the study.  My mother was out 15of town but granted permission for me to go to your 16house because not only did she love and trust you, 17but because I was supposed to be one of several 18subjects participating in your Michigan State study.  19I got a ride to your apartment from my neighbor, and, 20predictably, there were no other subjects there.  You 21instructed me to disrobe and take a bath in your tub 22in order to heat my muscles and relax which would 23aide in your measuring of my flexibility.  24After my bath you rewarded me for my 25169generous participation in your study by having me lay 1naked on the treatment table in the living room of 2your sparse one bedroom apartment as you massaged the 3entirety of my 12 year old body, suggesting that I 4relax as you slipped your adult fingers in and out 5and in and out of my body.  6That was one of the many, many times that 7your hands were in me, on me over the next many 8years.  You became a doctor, started treating more 9patients, and we all know how the rest of this story 10unfolds.  11Now here we sit, Larry, exactly 30 years 12since our paths first crossed.  Next year I will be 1340 years old.  And you, you're spending the rest of 14your life in prison.  What you have to live with at 15this point as a purported Catholic man is not my 16problem and, quite frankly, I really do not care, but 17what I have to live with?  I may be the oldest victim 18survivor here this week.  Had I not been sucked into 19your pretend care and pretend love, had I not trusted 20you, had I actually understood that having my vagina 21and anus penetrated by a grown man that I loved and 22trusted when I was 12, 13, 14, and beyond was not 23okay and that was not your love or your care for me 24or your duty as my athletic trainer or Michigan State 2517045 of 57 sheetsPage 171 to 174 of 21702/13/2018 09\n",

      "26 AMmedical school student or Michigan State doctor or 1Olympic doctor, then I could have spared every girl 2who came after me and the suffering that only someone 3who has experienced this will understand.  4You chose to take from me, from all of us, 5something that was simply not yours to take; a 6shaken, if not irreparable, sense of self, a grave 7inability to trust, to open ourselves up to love, to 8sleep, to work, and some days to breathe.  What you 9took was sick and psychotic and disturbed and bottom 10line a robbery.  Had I been able to identify the wolf 11in sheep's clothing of a sexual predator under the 12guise of a loving friend and medical professional and 13eventual employee of the trusted Michigan State 14University, none of the other girls would be standing 15here before you this week having to face you, their 16robber.  17So what you need to hear from me today is 18this.  When a grown man penetrates the vagina and/or 19the anus of a small girl or does anything at all to 20compromise her sense of trust or safety, the course 21of her life is changed forever.  In that moment when 22you had each and every girl who is here this week on 23your table, not to mention the hundreds and 24thousands, potentially, of girls who are not here or 25171have not yet come forward, in that split second when 1you made the choice to put that finger inside of our 2little tiny bodies for the first time, not for 3medical treatment but for your own pleasure, you 4changed the entire course of our lives.  One moment, 5one finger, you took something from us that we will 6never, ever get back.  Our innocence.  Our 7childhoods.  And, in a sense, our virginities.  Those 8were not yours to take.  9And yet in that moment when you took each 10of us -- from each of us for the first time, the 11course of your life did not change -- well, not 12immediately anyway.  You ate dinner.  You brushed 13your teeth.  And you went to sleep.  You were 14rewarded with prestigious roles.  You got to travel 15the world.  You were entrusted with the job of caring 16for the United State's most talented gymnasts.  You 17went to the Olympics, not once, many times, before 18John and then with John.  19How each victim survivor has and will 20continue to navigate this life-altering catalytic 21experience that you chose for us will run the entire 22spectrum.  Some will never trust, never engage in 23functional relationships, sexual or otherwise, and 24some will never give birth because the very thought 25172of having to see a physician who will have to touch 1them in personal places paralyzes them.  2Some will suffer from anxiety and sleepless 3nights for the rest of their lives.  Some will never 4overcome the depression that results from having been 5a victim of your sexual abuse.  6Others will become activists, warriors for 7this cause.  They will dedicate their lives to 8ensuring that people like you are not enabled and in 9a sense indirectly permitted to do as much damage as 10you were enabled to do by the likes of Michigan State 11University, USA Gymnastics, and Twistars.  12And me, Larry?  I want you to know that 13while you spend the rest of your life behind bars, my 14life has been and will be okay.  I am a survivor of 15stage four disease.  I live with two autoimmune 16diseases, and I haven't slept soundly since 1992.  I 17could spend another hour depicting how I personally, 18medically, and psychologically have suffered at your 19hands, but, quite frankly, I don't care to.  All you 20need to know about me, Larry, is that I'm free, I am 21successful, I am a mother, and I am happy.  Not 22because you were one of the most, if not the most, 23formative males in my entire life but in spite of you 24and in spite of that fact.  I am okay.  25173What I know for sure, Larry, is this, your 1legacy will not be that of a healer, of a great 2Olympic, Michigan State doctor, of a respectable man, 3of a good father, or husband, or son.  Unfortunately, 4your legacy is that you are quite possibly the 5greatest perpetrator of sexual abuse of all time.  6That, my former friend and loved one, is yours to 7live with.  8None of us in this room, Larry, is your 9final judge.  You may attempt to do good while you 10are in prison, removed from society for the rest of 11your life, and knowing you, you will and you will 12try, but what you've done, what you've taken, and how 13boldly and shamelessly you've taken it for decade 14after decade after decade, I can only wonder what 15might become of your soul.  16I pray for Steph and your children because 17the Lord knows they need it now and they will always 18need it.  And I pray for the hundreds of women you 19abused who have not come forward, each for their own 20heavy reasons.  21And as for you, Larry, the rest of your 22life you will be a prisoner, but what should we call 23you?  A predator?  A criminal?  A molester?  A 24psychopath?  A pornographer?  An abuser?  A thief of 2517402/13/2018 09\n",

Because as you 17know as a lawyer, as a trained individual, so much 18goes unreported because of the pointing of blame, not 19belief of the treachery.  When you talk about it, 20people don't want to believe it.  It's not a popular 21subject.  There's no one that blames you, and you 22need to just let go of that, because you've done so 23well, and I think that's a bit of a stumbling block, 24and you are absolutely correct, your life is 25176wonderful and it will continue to be so and you are 1just this -- because you're a little bit older -- no 2offense, you're beautiful, but you're a little bit 3older than the rest of the victims, so they can look 4at you and say, I can be like her, because some of 5them are not as strong as you yet, so it's so 6important that you talk about what you did, what you 7accomplished, that you've let go of this, and the 8only thing I ask you is to let go of that 12 year old 9girl, give her permission to say it's okay, I didn't 10report it, because you know at 12 you are powerless 11really.  You don't have a voice.  There were adults 12who should have been watching and checking.  It's not 13your fault there's other victims, so let go of that, 14and thank you for being such a strong role model with 15such an epic voice.

      "  When our kids were little 5Lindsey's dad and I thought we made every effort to 6keep our kids safe from harm, but what we did not 7realize was that we missed what the true concern was.  8It wasn't the wrong crowd or going places that they 9weren't supposed to be or even using drugs or 10alcohol.  It was something we never thought we would 11have to even think about, it was this man, Larry 12Nassar.  13He was someone we completely trusted.  He 14was our friend, our neighbor, Lindsey's friend, and 15her doctor.  Someone who was so well respected by 16everyone we never second-guessed his intentions on 17our daughter.  18Larry had been Lindsey's doctor since she 19was nine years old.  He was also Lindsey's mentor, 20her confidant, her employer, and he was also someone 21who ultimately abused her on a daily basis for many, 22many years, starting around the age of 10.  These 23photos are how little she was when he began the abuse 24on her.  25179He convinced these little girls that this 1was a medical treatment necessary to help their 2injuries.  He also told and convinced the little 3girls not to discuss this treatment with their 4parents because they would not understand.  This 5treatment continued for many years.  These children 6thought that this was the norm.  He was doing it to 7multiple gymnasts so they all thought this was what 8Larry did to make them feel better.  9These girls had no idea this wasn't a 10medical procedure.  He had always told -- we always 11told both our kids that if anyone touches you down in 12your private areas, except for a doctor, to come to 13us immediately.  She had no reason to be alarmed 14because he was her doctor, just as we told her.  He 15was also someone she completely trusted, her sound 16board after a long, hard practice.  Why would he ever 17want to harm her?  18Our family was devastated to learn of 19Larry's actions.  We did not want to believe it, but 20it hit hard and fast.  The betrayal we feel is 21sometimes very hard to grasp.  Our daughter is 22scarred forever.  Our son is scarred forever, and we 23as parents are scarred forever.  24Lindsey's dad, her brother, and I will 25180never be the same.  We trust no one.  We have many 1sleepless nights over the guilt we feel for missing 2this.  We never imagined that we would be those 3parents we all see on the news whose children were 4abused by someone, someone close to their family, and 5the parents had no idea.  This is us.  This is our 6true reality.  7The guilt we feel will never go away.  All 8the questions we think of and all the red flags we 9missed, it truly has been gut wrenching and will be 10embedded in our minds forever.  11With his lack of true remorse, this is a 12person who will repeat his crimes.  You can hear it 13in his statements to you and other judges that he 14still does not accept the damage he has done to all 15these kids, parents, his own family, and all that was 16associated with him.  17Your Honor, we ask that you give this 18monster the longest sentence available so he never 19harms again.  The longest sentence will give him many 20years in prison thinking about how many people he has 21hurt over the past 30 years.  Thank you.  22THE COURT\n",
      "  Thank you all for being here 23and for your words.  24There is no guilt to carry.  I know you all 25181will be and are -- you said that you are, but you 1didn't know.  The guilt would be if you did know and 2didn't do anything.  You didn't know.  The medical 3procedure is a big word that covers so much ground 4and, of course, your daughter being 10, she didn't 5know the difference.  There's no shame.  I can't heal 6you, but this is a huge step.7And I'm really honored that you're here 8together, especially a divorced couple unified in 9this for your daughter.  That's exemplary not just 10here but in family court where we see so many 11families that couldn't come together on behalf of 12their children, and you two parents coming together 13despite whatever issues you may have had for the 14benefit of your daughter is exemplary on so many 15levels.  16There's no guilt, no shame associated with 17this because you have come forward, because this was 18not anything any of you did.  No victim did anything 19wrong.  Defendant did everything wrong, especially to 20coerce young victims who do not know better under the 21guise of medical procedure, and that's a big phrase 22for a little girl.  23So I understand not trusting anyone, being 24scarred forever, but scars heal and it's so very 2518202/13/2018 09\n",

      "  Thank you for letting us 23speak, first and foremost.  24Larry Nassar used to be an absolute god to 25183me.  I just turned 15 and was training for level 10 1gymnastics.  I had worked so hard to get there and I, 2along with my family, had sacrificed so much to get 3to that point.  My spine was badly fractured and my 4life, but more important to me, my gymnastics career 5was falling apart.  6He was the only one I was wildly assured 7who could really help me, help me further than any 8other doctor had helped me so far.  He was just so 9talented and brilliant, they said.  Indeed, he did 10seem impressive.  11He was absurdly nice and did everything he 12could to make me feel comfortable the second I met 13him.  He smiled widely each time he saw me and on the 14surface it felt like he genuinely cared for me.  It 15seemed like he was determined to help me get better 16and that gave me another level of certainty.  Most of 17all, he gave me hope.  I thought he was the most 18trustworthy doctor I ever could have imagined.  In my 19innocence I felt that I would have done anything -- 20anything to heal my fractured back and not quit the 21sport I loved and persisted through since I was two 22years old.  23Gymnasts are tough as nails.  They will 24fight.  They will bleed.  And they will persist all 25184for their dreams.  And that's exactly how I was.  1I still remember Nassar calmly and vaguely 2assuring me that his treatment regiment might be a 3little uncomfortable but that it would surely help to 4heal my pain and return me to the sport I loved.  5These were just the magic words I was looking for 6that none of the many other doctors I had previously 7seen would tell me.  Here I was a scared little girl 8in excruciating back pain, willing, begging even to 9suffer through for my sport.  This grown man 10confidently offered me salvation, healing, and 11freedom, and I trusted him, but he turned out to be a 12monster.  13I am disgusted -- disgusted that Larry 14Nassar, the trusted adult, authority figure, and 15famous doctor had the audacity to use his incredible 16power, prestige, and influence to sexually abuse me, 17a little girl, right there in his office in the 18safest and warmest of places with such an overlying 19sense of healing and recovery.  I was counting on 20him.  He broke in loudly without consent or 21restraint.  He was an unwarranted intruder to my most 22private, intimate, never before touched places 23without warning, without gloves, and without 24explanation.  25185And so again and again and again he abused 1me all the while telling me wild tales of his Olympic 2journey and his family, very confidently, suavely 3even, trying to distract me from the un-distractable.  4It certainly seemed and, unfortunately, viscerally 5and physically felt like he had done this treatment 6many times before.  This was yet another reason I 7desperately told myself to trust him.  8THE COURT\n",

      "  Treatment after treatment 12with Nassar I closed my eyes tight, I held my breath, 13and I wanted to puke.  My stomach pierced me with 14pain.  To this day that pain and these feelings are 15still there.  16Each appointment with him I desperately 17waited for it to be over, to be healed, putting every 18last drop of faith in him.  I remember being 19embarrassed each time I rose off the table because it 20was so obviously drenched with sweat.  21Then one day after his prolonged and 22consistent abuse he finally gave me my fate.  My back 23could not be healed and I had to quit my dream.  He 24had all of his visits of fun with me and then sent me 2518649 of 57 sheetsPage 187 to 190 of 21702/13/2018 09\n",

      "26 AMaway depressed, dejected, molested, and confused, now 1alone to part ways with my deepest love, gymnastics.  2My innocence was ruthlessly taken away from me never 3to return.  4This was such a dark period in my life that 5still today is difficult for me to revisit.  As I 6stand here I still flashback to the feelings of fear 7laying frozen in his office, my sweating, shaking 8body, adrenalin pumping, painfully clutching the 9sides of the table waiting for this sick treatment to 10be over.  My little child self, smarter and more 11astute than I gave her credit for, knew something was 12wrong but she was petrified to the point of physical 13and emotional paralysis as she tried so hard to keep 14trusting this man she thought was her savior, 15vigilantly ignoring how she felt and what was really 16going on.  I was so afraid to talk to anyone.  17The most confusing part was that my mother 18was in the room with us while this happened.  He 19strategically placed himself between us and 20skillfully obscured what was happening.  I felt a 21disoriented sense of safety since my mom was there, 22and, after all, he told me it was going to be 23uncomfortable.  What I didn't realize, she couldn't 24see exactly what was happening.  This sickens and 25187continues to baffle me to this day.  1Larry made me believe that this was my only 2hope.  That he was my only hope.  Besides, all the 3other adults around me told me so, and I so shut my 4eyes so tight that they hurt and I held my breath.  I 5summoned that notorious gymnastic strength and I 6marched forward.  7For years I had this atrocious secret and 8fear.  I felt so much shame and embarrassment.  I 9suffered but I told myself to be tough.  When the 10reports about him started trickling out I just knew I 11was right all this time and I wasn't alone.  12Then my world swiftly stopped.  Everything 13I had pushed away for so long came over me like a 14waterfall.  All my denial, repression, and depression 15that had been present and underlying there all along 16overcame me.  My trauma reopened anew; a fresh deep 17wound.  18While the constant news following Nassar 19this past year has been vindicating at some points, 20it has mostly been cruel and exhausting.  I relive my 21pain each and every day questioning why he did this 22to us and never finding the right answer.  23I completely dropped out of my life this 24past year as the gravity and wickedness of Nassar's 25188serial abuse has overcome me.  Months at a time I did 1not leave my bed, sometimes questioning why I was 2even alive, all while his touch continued to 3violently linger on my body as it does today.  I lost 4my wits.  I screamed.  I woke up crying.  I went to 5bed crying.  I did not, I still do not understand.  6These uncomfortable, invasive memories are 7my reality now.  The imprint of his face and abuse 8hinder my life which at times has turned into a 9nightmare.  Crippling complexes such as paranoia, 10anxiety, depression, sexual issues, and insomnia, to 11name a few, have all taken their unique and 12oppressive turn at overshadowing my life as a direct 13result of what Larry Nassar did to me.  Then and now 14his abuse has cost me.  15It is important to everyone hearing this 16that to this day I still do not feel safe.  The world 17feels unsafe.  Men feel unsafe.  I can't sleep 18without a night light.  I'm paranoid when I walk 19anywhere alone, looking around every corner 20constantly believing I'm about to be attacked.  If 21someone enters a room without announcing themselves I 22jump and border on the edge of a nervous breakdown.  23I'm intensely vigilant that someone, somewhere, 24whichever place I might be is about to take advantage 25189of, sexualize, or hurt me.  1There are oftentimes I shield myself from 2the world and pray that men don't find me appealing 3lest they target me, manipulate me, and hurt me like 4Nassar so smoothly did.  I feel disconnected from the 5world, alone, and in pain.  I couldn't trust anyone 6to keep me safe back then and I can't trust anyone to 7keep me safe today.  I have lost my ability to be 8confident with myself and others.  9To those at MSU, USAG, and the USOC who 10knew about Larry Nassar and did not act, the sin of 11omission is just as bad as the sin itself.  As if 12dealing with the intense publicity and pain around 13Nassar wasn't enough, you have added a heartless, 14depraved level of denial and victim shaming to the 15mix.  16You have said terrible things.  For 17example, that victims didn't understand the nuanced 18difference between sexual abuse and medical treatment 19and it is virtually impossible to stop a determined 20sexual predator on your campus.  This is disgusting.  21Do you know how the statements make us feel?  Do you 22understand the impacts of our words?  Do you know how 23these statements put other victims in the state of 24fear so deep that they may never come forward?  2519002/13/2018 09\n",

This means that 5every day we still have to remind ourselves it's okay 6that we came forward.  What happened to us is very, 7very real, even though we so desperately tried to 8deny it for so long.  9I recently learned that Nassar's crimes 10could have been prevented as early as 1997 when the 11first brave woman came forward.  Learning our abuse 12could have been prevented but instead flourished for 13decades is a bitter and nauseating pill to swallow.  14Adults were enamored by Nassar because they 15experienced all of the trustworthy, impressive, 16illustrious talented elements of him, minus the 17abuse.  They wanted to protect him, and now that the 18act is up, they are emotionless and indifferent, 19lackadaisically managing the issues they once 20overlooked and placing their limited information on 21evading responsibility as opposed to taking 22ownership.

I 1was a no name high school athlete that got injured 2during practice and was sent to see him due to a 3referral.  4What he did physically to me for three 5years is nothing in comparison to what I have 6emotionally and mentally endured.  7I still have medical issues that he was 8supposed to be treating me for but failed.  I do not 9trust doctors because of how he took advantage of me 10for his own sick pleasures.  I do not trust people to 11know that this story belongs to me as he makes me 12feel dirty, disgusting, and ashamed.  13What he did to me has damaged my future as 14I do not find myself worthy of love.

I cannot look at my mother the same.  4I called my mother after talking to an attorney and 5she expressed how relieved she was that I was doing 6something about what he did to me.  I was so 7confused.  After talking with her more about it, she 8knew what he was doing but thought it was a medical 9procedure just like everyone else.  She said that it 10made her uncomfortable and that is why she stopped 11going to my appointments.  I felt abandoned.  I lost 12faith and trust in her role as a mother.  13Since this has come out it has made me very 14hypervigilant on whether anyone knows who I am, who 15can I trust to tell, and how do I tell them something 16like this?  Also, if I do tell them, what if someone 17overhears?  Will people look at me differently?  Will 18people judge me or will they pity me because they 19feel bad?  20Larry Nassar manipulated me 21psychologically.  He made me deny how I felt when I 22was screaming inside to stop what was happening 23because he acted so calm like nothing ever happened.  24He made me trust him and not second-guess his medical 25195procedure.  1There are things in my past that I am not 2proud of.

The blaming of yourself 5needs to stop, and today after this statement, that 6was very well written, you need to have that same 7strength as you leave this courthouse and rebuild 8your life. 9It's a common thread that I hear that 10victims of any criminal sexual conduct crime feel 11dirty, disgusting, ashamed, unloved, but I assure you 12no one feels that about you, and every day when you 13look in the mirror you need to say to yourself that 14you love yourself and everybody here loves you and 15all the victims.  That's why we've all come together 16globally, a strong, united voice, so I thank you for 17your words.  I'm hopeful that you get stronger every 18day and realize that there's no shame in being a 19victim, and there's only strength in coming forward 20and being the role model for others.  21There is shame in not reporting and not 22standing up for yourself and others, perhaps, but not 23today, not here.

      "  Your Honor, my name is Katelyn 18Skrabis.  As a young child I fell in love with the 19sport of gymnastics.  I spent countless hours in the 20gym mastering my skills and routines.  My dream was 21to somehow make a college gymnastics team.  22Like many other gymnasts, I was plagued 23with injuries.  I was 15 years old when I first saw 24Larry Nassar for my back pain.  It has now been over 2519802/13/2018 09\n",

      "26 AMPage 199 to 202 of 21752 of 57 sheetsa decade since I was treated by Larry Nassar.  I can 1still remember vividly every detail about what he did 2to me during his so-called treatment.  3After leaving his office at MSU I was 4completely humiliated and mortified.  I was scared 5and confused about what had happened to me.  I didn't 6know how to approach anyone to tell them about what 7had happened out of embarrassment and fear.  8The memory of what Larry Nassar did haunted 9me on a daily basis.  I eventually quit gymnastics, 10never seeking another doctor to address my back pain.  11Even after my career in gymnastics was over I still 12thought about what had happened to me.  13Since all of this has come to light, the 14memory of what Larry Nassar did to me has only been 15intensified.  Not only do I think about what Larry 16did to me, but to all the other victims as well.  The 17thought of Larry Nassar remains in my daily thoughts 18and my dreams.  It is a memory that I will never 19forget.  20Nothing can change what Larry Nassar did to 21me and the other victims.  I hope he receives the 22maximum sentence and spends the rest of his remaining 23days thinking about what he did to all of us.  24Sincerely, Katelyn Skrabis.  25199THE COURT\n",

      "  Thank you.  Your Honor, I 5appreciate the opportunity to address the court in 6order to tell my story and the impact that the abuse 7I suffered by Mr. Nassar has had on me. 8I was 17 when I went to see Mr. Nassar for 9help with my back pain.  At the time my father was 10terminally ill with cancer so my parents were unable 11to attend this appointment.  Mr. Nassar took 12advantage of my circumstances and of me.  13I remember him telling me that he could 14give me a massage to help with my back pain.  I 15cautiously undressed and laid down with a sheet over 16me as he instructed.  He proceeded to penetrate me 17vaginally and massage my breasts.  My body froze.  I 18was screaming inside but lay there too scared and 19confused to do anything.  20After he completed his, quote, treatment, 21he told me to get dressed while he sat there 22watching.  He then scheduled weekly visits for me.  23In a daze I left the office only to be stopped by the 24receptionist to schedule my next appointment.  I 25201informed her he had already done so to which she 1looked confused and responded, quote, he doesn't 2schedule his own appointments.  After reviewing my 3chart she was hesitant but verified that he had 4scheduled these.  5Looking back I realize that he had 6scheduled these to continue the abuse.  He had found 7a young girl in a vulnerable situation and intended 8to take full advantage of that situation.  9When I got home from school that day I told 10my mom what had happened.  She took me to the police 11station where I filed a report and went to the 12hospital to get a sexual assault kit done.  I was 13terrified of what this exam entailed.  I sat in a 14cold hospital room, my body tensed when they took the 15samples.  I remember fearing that no one would 16believe me.  Unfortunately, this fear became a 17reality.  18About a week later the police contacted my 19family and asked us to come in for a meeting with Mr. 20Nassar.  I told my parents that I did not want to 21face him so they went without me.  At this meeting 22Mr. Nassar informed my parents that this was simply a 23misunderstanding and that because I was not a 24gymnast, I was not as comfortable with my body.  2520253 of 57 sheetsPage 203 to 206 of 21702/13/2018 09\n",

      "26 AMThere was no investigation and I was left to feel 1like the whole situation was my fault.  2I felt powerless and like there was no one 3I could trust.  I struggled with these feelings as I 4watched my dad dying right in front of me.  My 5anxiety was at an all time high.  I suffered so 6severely that at times I was unable to leave my home.  7I began medication and therapy.  To this day I still 8suffer from anxiety and continue with these 9treatments 13 years later.  10I went on with my life and successfully 11pursued my career as a physician assistant.  However, 12the memory of what happened never left me.  For 13 13years I wondered if I was the only one or if there 14were others he had done this to.  I tried to convince 15myself that I was the only one and that I had scared 16him enough by filing a police report so that he would 17never do this again.  Sadly, this was not the case.  18I remember the day I found out about the 19other allegations.  I broke down and a huge wave of 20guilt came over me.  I felt like I should have done 21more to stand up for myself and to prevent the abuse 22of the other women.  As the number of victims grew 23and the stories came out, I was horrified.  Mr. 24Nassar took away the innocence of so many young women 25203and girls.  He blamed us for, quote, misunderstanding 1what had happened.  2I will never forget what Mr. Nassar did to 3me but I do have a sense of relief knowing that no 4other young woman or child will be subjected to his 5abuse.  6I recently gave birth to my first child and 7therefore was unable to travel to Michigan for 8sentencing.  This is a joyous time in my life but the 9trauma from the past and the realization of the 10extent of his abuse has put a cloud over it.  I will 11move on and continue to be a loving wife and mother.  12I will continue my work as a PA and provide 13compassionate care to other victims of sexual abuse.  14I hope that some day he will realize the 15affects he has had on his victims and their families.  16I am hopeful that today will provide justice and 17assistance in the healing process for all of Mr. 18Nassar's victims.  19Sincerely, Brianne Randall.  20THE COURT\n",
      "  Thank you for reading that.  I 21don't know if Brianne is listening or not but there 22will be a record, and what I want to say to her is 23that today with her words there is no 24misunderstanding of what happened.  I am very clear 25204that no victim has lied, that they were all 1assaulted, that the use of treatment was misused, 2mis-defined, and I suspect that there were 3appointments that were not needed, probably in 4violation of other statutes, insurance paid for this, 5so the crimes just get bigger and bigger, and I'm 6saddened that Meridian Township Police Department, 7who I know to be very efficient, very good, and we 8hear testimony all the time from them, I see the good 9work they do, I'm sorry they missed this one.  But, 10again, defendant became a good liar, and what 11happened, what I'm gathering from all these victims, 12is that because Meridian Township, because 13universities, because parents, all unsuspecting, 14seemingly, defended him, he felt untouchable so he 15continued to touch children for his own pleasure.  16I have heard what Ms. Randall has said and 17I applaud her words, and I can't imagine not being 18believed while her father is dying, so she's grieving 19the loss of her childhood and the loss of a parent.  20That is immeasurable pain, so I thank her for her 21words.  22Next.  23MS.

      "  In September 2016 I received 9a Daily News e-mail from my local patch.com.  The top 10headline read, Former USA Gymnastics doctor accused 11of abuse.  I will never forget that moment.  I was 12stopped at a red light near my home.  There was a 13picture of him along with the headline.  I had to 14pull my car over.  I dry heaved in the street while 15sobbing uncontrollably.  I was disgusted by myself 16and my body.  I felt dirty and helpless, so very lost 17and so very sad. 18I called the Michigan State Police 19Department that day, and after five years of silence 20I reported his abuse.  I had to relive all his 21treatments and every question, every detail, 22remembering how he touched me and penetrated me 23without gloves or lubricant.  I cried for weeks and 24then months.  2520602/13/2018 09\n",

      "26 AMPage 207 to 210 of 21754 of 57 sheetsIt has affected my role as a mother, as a 1daughter, and as a wife.  But the last year I've had 2to put a brave face on in front of my young children 3to protect them from their sad, confused, and 4grieving mother.  I have had to forgive my parents 5for not being more involved in my treatments as an 6injured and defeated young college athlete.  I have 7had to explain to my loving husband why intimacy had 8become difficult for me.  I will be affected by 9Doctor Nassar's abuse for the rest of my life.  10At the time of the treatment I hated his 11demeanor.  His use of too much medical jargon, his 12groping and his touching of my vaginal area inside 13and out.  I dreaded every appointment.  14I was suffering from a herniated disc, L-5 15and S-1, and had chronic nerve pain shooting down my 16legs.  I had already had one surgery and was trying 17to avoid a second more serious spinal fusion surgery 18because I knew the impact it would have on my 19collegiate athletic career and my life.  I was 20 20years old.  21All I wanted to do was to be able to 22compete in my sport again and live a pain-free, 23active lifestyle.  My athletic trainer trusted that 24Doctor Nassar would live up to his reputation.  25207Doctor Nassar was recommended to me as the 1second opinion outside the medical team at the 2University of Michigan.  His reputation, his 3authority, his accolades cloud the truth behind the 4procedures that was supposed to alleviate the nerve 5pain and to help me avoid surgery.  They didn't.  I 6had to have that spinal fusion surgery, but not 7before I endured several sessions of pure torture and 8agony.  9Each treatment was an hour.  He massaged my 10breasts, buttocks, groin, hips, and would end with 11what felt like endless digital penetration.  Doctor 12Nassar never stopped his hands.  His treatments made 13mefeel like I was an animal, a piece of meat.  I 14remember using a rough paper towel in his office 15after treatment to wipe him off of me before leaving 16the exam room.  I remember being sore inside.  17As a student athlete on scholarship at a 18Division One, Big Ten university with strength 19coaches, head coaches, assistant coaches, trainers, 20sports doctors, and physical therapists, the list 21goes on and on, our bodies were our most prized 22possession.  We trained them, worked them, and dealt 23with high levels of pain running through them.  Mind 24over matter.  Athletics were not something I did, an 25208athlete was who I was.  1Keeping my body healthy to maintain my spot 2on the field and maintain my financial scholarship 3was the most important thing in my life.  I was 20 4years old but still a child living within the bubble 5division one Big Ten college sports.  I had to trust 6my coaches, trainers, and physical therapists.  I had 7to trust my doctors.  No questions asked.  Doctor 8Nassar knew this.  Doctor Nassar preyed on my 9desperation and my weakness.10It is my opinion that Doctor Nassar should 11be held accountable for his strategic and 12manipulative abuse.  His sentence should keep him in 13prison for the rest of his life just as I was a 14victim of his abuse for the rest of mine.  15Thank you, victim two. 16THE COURT\n",

       " \"  Good morning.  My name is Kyle Stephens.  Up until this point I have been known as victim ZA or family friend.  I was the first to testify in this case, and weary of the attention that can come with that, I asked for anonymity.  This process has been horrific, but surprisingly therapeutic.  I am addressing you publicly today as a final step and statement to myself that I have nothing to be ashamed of. I met Larry Nassar when I was somewhere around the age of five years old.  My parents had become close friends with Larry and his wife, Stephanie.  They were all medical professionals and shared a passion for the subject.  Most Sundays Stephanie and my mother would cook dinner together for both families.  We shared sporting events, holidays, and many weekends in between.  It was during this time, I estimate I was approximately six years old, that Larry Nassar began to sexually abuse me.  He first exposed his penis to me in a dark boiler room in the basement of his home.  He told me, if you ever want to see it, all you have to do is ask.  He used his power as an adult to manipulate me.  Over a six year period he progressed from exposure to masturbating in front of me while playing hide and go seek, rubbing his bare penis on my bare feet, and penetrating my vagina with his fingers, all of which took place with my parents, my sibling, his wife, and his children in the same house.  Let me remind you of the interests of a six year old girl.  My favorite t.v. show was Clifford, the big red dog, and my favorite book was Junnie B. Jones.  I could not do a multiplication problem and still had not lost all my baby teeth.  I think we can all agree that someone of this maturity level should not be sexually active.  But I was.  Without my knowledge or consent I had engaged in my first sexual experience by kindergarten and joined an overwhelming statistic of sexual abuse victims.  It took the media coverage of the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic church and a friend confiding the details of her sexual abuse for me to realize that something was wrong.  I was  years old when I told my parents, when Larry rubbed my feet, he used his penis.  My parents confronted him and he denied any such action.  Due to complex details that I won't get into here, my parents chose to believe Larry Nassar over me.  I spent the years between  and  avoiding and detaching from my family.  To my father, someone who makes such heinous false accusations is the worst type of person.  His belief that I had lied seeped into the foundation of our relationship.  Every time we got into a fight he would tell me, you need to apologize to Larry.  I learned to ask for very little as I wanted my parents to know that I didn't need them, just as I felt they didn't want me.  It wasn't until I was about to leave for college when my father again pulled a need to apologize card and then I took another chance of clearing my name.  I told him that I wasn't lying and that Larry Nassar had indeed sexually abused me.  Larry Nassar's actions had already caused me significant anguish, but I hurt worse as I watched my father realize what he had put me through.  My father and I did our best to patch up our tattered relationship before he committed suicide in .  Admittedly, my father was experiencing debilitating health issues, but had he not had to bear the shame and self-loathing that stemmed from // \",\n",

       " \" AMPage  to  of  of  sheetshis defense of Larry Nassar, I believe he would have had a fighting chance for his life.  Larry Nassar wedged himself between myself and my family and used his leverage as my parents' trusted friend to pry us apart until we fractured.  And fractured we did.  My relationship with my mother is still marbled with pain, anger, and resentment, and for a long time I told people that I did not have a family.  I think it is important to note my relationship with the Nassar family after I accused him at age .  A year or two passed from the time that I made the accusation and our families began to spend time together again.  I was around  years old when Stephanie began pressuring me to babysit the Nassars' three children.  I responded with dismissive answers for a lengthy period of time before relenting.  It was at this point that I began to feel brainwashed.  At home I was a liar and when I was at the Nassars, either with my family or babysitting, it was as if I never accused him.  I felt I was losing my grip on reality.  I started to question whether the abuse ever really happened.  For my own sanity, I forced myself to walk through the abuse step by step so I didn't forget that I was not a liar.  It is to this that I credit my ability to recall the abuse so well throughout this process.  As I continued to babysit for the Nassars I started to become resolved to my purpose there.  With two young girls in the home I felt protective and that somehow my presence there would make a difference.  For seven years and several years into counseling -- for seven years and several years into counseling I cared for those children with all my heart.  My detachment from my family forced me to search for grants, participate in post-traumatic studies, ask for sliding scales, and babysit for the Nassars to pay for my own counseling.  When I look back now, I realize that my spirit was broken, lost, and confused, but then all I could think is that I needed to be there for those children in whatever way I could.  It was not until I was  that I cut all ties with the Nassar family.  The complex feelings of shame, disgust, and self hatred brought me bouts of depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and other compulsive conditions.  Sometimes I think it's hard for people to translate these generic terms into reality.  For me, it was a girl crying on the floor for hours trying not to rip out too much of her hair.  For me, it was a girl wanting the pain to stop so badly that she woke up for months to the thought, I want to die.  For me, it was a girl getting out her gun and laying it on the bed just to remind herself that she has control over her own life.  For me, it was a girl that spent so much time trying to fix herself that she forgot what she actually enjoys doing.  Sexual abuse is so much more than disturbing physical acts.  It changes the trajectory of a victim's life, and that is something that no one has the right to do.  Your Honor, with your permission, I would now like to address the defendant.  THE COURT\",\n",

You convinced my parents that I was a liar, that you didn't keep lotion strategically placed in the basement so you could beat your penis in my face while I hid.  But I still get sick at the smell of that lotion.  You convinced my parents that you didn't pull my feet into your lap, unzip your pants, and rub your erect penis against my bare skin, but I still flinch when my feet are near someone's lap.  You convinced my parents that you didn't stick your fingers in my adolescent vagina, but I knew when it was time to use my first tampon not to worry because my hymen wasn't intact.  You used my body for six years for your own sexual gratification.  That is unforgiveable.  I have been coming for you for a long time.  I've told counselors your name in hopes that they would report you.  I have reported you to Child Protective Services twice.  I gave a testament to get your medical license revoked.  You were first arrested on my charges, and now as the only non-medical victim to come forward, I testify to let the world know that you are a repulsive liar and that those treatments were pathetically veiled sexual abuse.

I can also tell you Larry Nassar is a predator without boundaries.  His patients weren't safe, his friends' children weren't safe, and even his own children weren't safe.  If he is ever allowed to reenter society, he will not hesitate to re-offend.

       " \"  Thank you.  Honorable Judge Aquilina, thank you for giving me this opportunity to tell you how Larry Nassar has hurt me and the effect that this has had on my life. I am Jessica Thomashow, also known as victim A.  I was sexually assaulted by Larry Nassar when I was nine and  years old.  Today I am  and a senior in high school, and this is my story.  My childhood was filled with happiness and love.  One of my loves was for gymnastics and for all my teammates in the gym.  Gymnastics was a big part of my childhood, and I spent many hours in the gym and at competitions, though, as you know, with gymnastics it is a very physically demanding sport and often comes with painful injuries.  I remember one of my first injuries, a rib misplacement.  This was the first time I heard of Larry Nassar and his reputation.  I remember telling my mom that my coaches told me I should see Larry Nassar for my injury, and to my surprise, she knew who he was.  She had trained under him when she went to medical school at Michigan State University.  One night my coaches arranged for me to see Nassar after practice to help with my rib injury.  Monday nights were when Larry Nassar came to Twistars to treat injured team gymnasts.  I remember my coaches telling me to go see him, and I was actually quite excited.  Then I went into the back room, and that's when everything changed.  I was alone in the back room with him.  He had me lie down on the table and he sexually assaulted me.  He touched the most innocent places on my body that day.  I remember fear and pain and asking myself, what is happening?  When it was over, I was so confused.  What had he just done to me, and why?  It was awful and embarrassing.  I left and kept the disgusting thing that had just happened to me to myself.  Two years passed.  I saw him several times again at his clinic at MSU, always with my mom, and they were normal appointments.  Then in  it happened again, right around my th birthday.  I had a stress fracture in my ankle and my dad took me to that appointment.  Before Nassar assaulted me, we had a great, meaningful conversation about my future.  He asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, and I said, I want to be just like you, a sports medicine doctor.  He gave me a gift, a pin from the Olympics, and told me, when you take my place as the new sports  of  sheetsPage  to  of // \",\n",
       " '',\n",
       " \" AMmedicine doctor for gymnastics, then you can give me back this pin.  Nassar then told my dad he had to massage my ankle and it would be okay for him to wait in the waiting room.  After he left, Nassar told the medical student to leave the room, too.  After the room was cleared, he did it yet again.  He slid his ungloved hand up my leg and back into the most innocent part of my body, and I felt searing pain.  For  minutes he inserted his fingers into me and grunted while I lay there terrified.  Again I was confused by what had just happened.  He was a trusted doctor and what he did to me didn't make sense in my child's mind.  I didn't tell a sole, and I try not to think about it anymore, but my dream of becoming a sports medicine doctor ended that day along with my happy and trusting self.  He had broken me.  I lived the next several years in limbo.  Being sexually assaulted has changed me into an anxious teen, but I did not know that I had been abused and that was the source of my anxiety.  I no longer felt safe, and I had problems with trust.  My parents took me to a psychiatrist and a therapist when I was in ninth grade and this happened.  I was diagnosed with and treated for social anxiety disorder and saw a therapist on a weekly basis but did not have insight into the cause.  In the seventh and eighth grade I felt extremely uncomfortable around my male teachers.  I avoided them.  I hated talking to them, and I would feel panic if I was ever alone with them in a room.  Back then I didn't understand why I felt this way because all my peers loved our teachers, but being assaulted affected my relationship with my teachers and my anxiety was so intense that it made it hard to focus and learn at school.  I also developed an intense fear of male hands, like a PTSD response.  Now I get flashbacks when I see male hands and it makes me feel scared and threatened.  This fear changed the way I grew up and how I related to boys.  I did not want to hold hands or ever be close to my guy friends.  I couldn't be just a normal girl anymore, and I have forever lost a big piece of my childhood due to his abuse.  When the first IndyStar article came out my life changed.  I put the pieces together and realized I was molested by Larry Nassar.  I thought back to my appointments with him and could still feel what my nine and  year old self felt then; alone, scared, and in pain.  I wanted to puke.  I could feel his hands touching me, and that was the first time I had my first flashback, and to this day I still have them.  The flashbacks are paralyzing.  I had one just two weeks ago at school and could barely get out of my seat.  Thankfully I was able to stop my brain and went to the office.  I cried for an hour shaking with fear.  I would like to say something to my abuser, Larry Nassar.  You took advantage of my innocence and trust.  You were my doctor and I trusted you and you took complete advantage of that.  Why?  I used to ask myself that question all the time, especially while I was laying in bed crying myself to sleep.  What you did to me was so twisted.  You manipulated me and my entire family.  How dare you.  You had no right to do that, and because of your decision to molest me, you have caused so much pain in my life, and for the rest of my life I'm going to have to heal from what you did.  Your Honor, I understand the plea guidelines are for a minimum sentence range of  to  years, and I ask you to give Larry Nassar a  year minimum to  year maximum sentence for what he did to me.  I also ask on behalf of what he did to over a hundred other girls, we are all suffering having flashbacks, unable to have normal relationships, crying at night, feeling broken, and our lives have been forever changed.  He is a predator, and he won't be stopped unless he is behind bars for the rest of his life.  Thank you.  THE COURT\",\n",

       " '  Your Honor, today I stand before you simply as victim D in the Ingham County case.  I am a minor and presently have not come forward with my identity.  I am a sheltered Christian, home-schooled girl who is still in competitive gymnastics.  From a young age I was raised to respect those in authority.  I was also taught that there are certain people who are there to help you; doctors, teachers, pastors, police officers, so going to see Nassar at the age of  it was -- that was my belief system, that he was there to help me.  I can remember the first time he assaulted me like it was yesterday.  I cried all the way home because of what he did to me.  He made me feel so yucky that I could not imagine this is what I had to endure to get better.  But I was .  I had never heard of a doctor purposely hurting someone.   when this began happening and  when I realized what happened; , a sophomore, and now a junior in high school.  What many people referred to as the best years of their life might have been the worst years of my life.  I can hardly explain what this past year and a half was like.  It was meetings and court appearances with attorneys, prosecutors, investigators, counselors.  It felt like endless meetings going back over a story that was so personal  of  sheetsPage  to  of // ',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " \" AMto talk about.  What  year old girl wants to discuss their private parts with grown men, or anyone for that matter?  It was embarrassing.  It was emotional, and I dreaded every meeting and court appearance I ever had to endure because it meant I was going to speak the assault out loud for everyone in the room.  Every time it forced me to relive the horrible experience again.  That was overwhelming.  It caused sleepless nights, lots of stress because I was trying to balance school, competitive gymnastics, which is a lot of time and travel, and then this awful situation, all while trying to have somewhat of a normal teenage life.  I did not want anyone to know.  I did not come out to my teammates and friends until right before I had to go to court in May.  Even right now I wrestled with lying to reveal my identity so that I no longer feel like I am hiding.  Plus, it would be nice to be able to say I'm a survivor.  But at the same time I am unsure.  I do not want anyone to look at my differently, especially when I walk out on the gymnastics floor.  I want to be known for who I am and my gymnastics, not for being a victim of Larry Nassar.  This situation has also affected my family.  Being only  when I realized I was sexually assaulted my parents have been heavily involved.  This has been extremely hard on my mom with lots of feeling of guilt for being in the room, for trusting, and for not asking enough questions.  She cries a lot, but she was determined to fight for justice for me and all the victims.  My dad, it's just hard hearing the story over and over again.  Knowing what this monster did to his little girl makes him sick.  In front of me he tries to remain strong.  My siblings have paid a price because it has often consumed our time and our days.  Part of our devastation is just knowing the time frame in which I was assaulted, starting in July , knowing it could have been easily avoided.  If anyone -- if one or any of the stipulations had been enforced by anyone overseeing Nassar, this would have never happened.  To my knowledge, I am the first known victim after he was allowed to go back to work in July .  That fact is almost inconceivable to us, that he was so brazen to do the sexual assault in front of my mom, but also knowing he was still under investigation.  It actually speaks volumes to what he knew he could get away with because no one was truly watching.  He had mastered his performance, his act, his actions, his every move.  To Larry Nassar, here are some of my thoughts.  You had it all, prestigious doctor, family, career, loved, worshipped by the gymnastics community, smart, honors, the list could go on and on, and you allowed evil to take over every part of you and committed some of the worst acts imaginable, on children.  The innocent, the trusting.  I cannot even comprehend this at  years old.  I may not ever be able to comprehend what you did and what you threw away, all for your evil desires.  Your apology/words at the hearing in November was not an apology.  If the judge gives you an opportunity to speak again before sentencing, you need to try again.  You need to sincerely apologize, not for the crazy words you spoke before about why you took the guilty plea, for the community to heal, that you never intended for this forest fire to get out of control.  Even at  years old I know those are silly statements.  It was not an apology to any victim or their family, but the victims need to hear you say I am sorry, please forgive me.  I made terrible decisions that were based on my own desires with no regards of how I was hurting you that day and forever.  I manipulated so many people, all part of my scheme to be able to do what I ultimately wanted to do, and now I am begging, if you ever can, to forgive me for my disgusting actions.  Those are the types of sentences you need to say.  Now I want you to know I stand today not as your judge, eventually that is God's job.  I stand today knowing that God's forgiveness extends to the worst offenses.  I stand today praying that God extends the same grace to you and that you reach out and take it, but you do need to ask him for it.  I also stand today extending my forgiveness to you, not because you deserve it, but because our family will allow this tragic event to frame -- will not allow this tragic event to frame our lives, so we release this poison by extending forgiveness.  Your Honor, what I want you to know -- what I want you to know most is I am only .  My whole life is ahead of me.  Most people as they grow up get to write their own story.  They make choices that affect the next days of their lives.  They make good choices and bad choices, but with each decision they are paving the way for their own stories.  They write it, their story.  // \",\n",

Without consent, without gloves, without prior explanation he wrote on my story, and it will always be a part of me.  What my future holds is unknown.  How it will affect my relationships, schooling, decisions, trusts of others, especially doctors and men all is unknown.  I do not want this to defeat me, define me, outshine me, or confine me.  But it will always be a part of my story.  I still have a lot ahead.  What  year old or anyone has to or wants to go through all of this?  Just writing this statement has been stressful and emotional.  There are not enough words to convey my actual feelings.  Plus there seems to be endless things I could or want -- plus there seems to be endless things I could or want to say.  The list could go on forever.  Even as I work on my statement with my mom, we cry.  As this settles I will turn the page and begin a new chapter, one that I will write myself.  I pray and trust the Lord will be all I need to sustain me from this affecting my story.  Larry Nassar wrote his own story.  He made decisions, awful disgusting decisions, and those decisions should affect the rest of his life.  We do not want him to ever have a chance to write on anyone's story.  You now have the unique opportunity, one that you have earned, to be able to write on his story.  My family and I have prayed for you.  We have prayed that your sentence is the maximum number of years but within the parameters of what the Attorney General and prosecutor have established.

She was delivered in a hospital using forceps and she required several surgeries, but for a whole year I sat up with this baby at night because she couldn't lay down, and the bond that came from her and I was just inseparable.  We did everything together as she continued to grow up.  Her childhood was a normal childhood and she wouldn't leave my side, and I needed to get her to be social with other kids so I enrolled her in Montessori, and for a whole week she screamed like a pig being cut because she thought I was leaving her, and finally on the fifth day she said, mommy, I know you'll be back.  I said, yes, I will.  I'm sorry.  During her normal childhood she, you know, wanted to do all the activities that all her little friends did, and we had these Saturday morning classes and the gymboree and the whatever, swim lessons, and so she really caught on to gymnastics, and she was enrolled at Artistic Gymnastics Academy in Roseville, Michigan, and her Saturday morning hour classes turned into several times a week, and then the coaches asked her if she would like to join team and I said, well, it's going to be her decision but she needed to understand the requirements and that she needed to understand the commitment of what it meant and the dedication, and she said, yes, this is what she wanted to do Well, that became five days a week, sometimes six, and she was made -- she went to team really quick because she was really good.  However, during -- she took a fall off of the beam and she injured her lower back and I asked our coach, I said, who should we go see?  And at this time she was ten years old.  And so -- and this was in .  And so they said, you know, go -- they referred us to Larry Nassar, and I said, okay.  Well, at the time we really didn't know, you know, much about him other than his medical reputation, so we went to see him and we traveled all the way from the east side of Michigan to Lansing, you know, several times a month for treatment. The last time that we went to treatment she was at that time  years old, and we had this thing, her and I, that we would, after her doctor visit, we would go to this little cafe in East Lansing and have lunch and enjoy each other for a while before we had that long drive back home, and so we got in the car -- and I had been in the room with her during her examination, as usual, and I said, are you ready to go to lunch and she's, like, no, mom, I just want to go home.  And I said, what's wrong?  Are you in pain?  And she said, mom, I just want to go home.  And I said, okay.  So we got in the car and I said -- and she started bawling and I said, Chelsey, tell me what's wrong.  And she said, mom, he put his fingers in me and they weren't gloved, and I said, Chelsey, I was right there in the room, and she goes, you couldn't see what was going on, mom.  And she said, he hurt me.  And I said, Chelsey, we're going back right now.  And I -- I mean, I was literally going to drive across the median on , and she said, mom, please don't do that.  I said, why?  And she said, because you don't understand, everybody will know, and everybody will judge me, and the judges will know when I compete, and I said, Chelsey, I can't do that, I have to go back.  Mom, please, we'll just find another doctor, and she begged me, and she was hysterical.  And I said, okay.  You know, I said, I'll talk to your dad about it, but I may end up going back, Chels.  So she went back to the gym the next day // \",\n",

       " \" AMPage  to  of  of  sheetsand I told her coach -- his name was Tim, and I told Tim about it, and he said, oh, no, that couldn't have happened.  I've known Larry for years.  And I said, well, Tim, it did happen.  So I told him I just wanted him to know what had happened.  So when I went into the balcony and was sitting with the rest of the moms, I said, You know, did any of your girls see Larry Nassar for treatment and a couple of them said, yes, and they said -- I said, did anything -- did they ever say anything about unusual behavior on his part?  And they said, well, no.  You know, they give me this look like you're lying to me, but anyways, that was neither here nor there at the time because they weren't going to say anything.  So we started a path of destruction, and her path of destruction was -- she was doing horrible in school.  She had this self loathing.  I had her see a psychiatrist and it didn't seem to be helping.  There was a lot of self blame.  She had managed to get through -- she had quit gymnastics the following year when she was  because she went to a meet here in Lansing at Twistars, I believe it was, and he was there and she fell off of every apparatus, she did horrible, and she said, I can't do this anymore because every time I see him I just flash back to what happened in his office. She made bad decisions.  It affected her social life.  She started running with bad crowds.  She got into drugs and she never really recovered.  The person that was my best friend, we used to do everything together, we would watch movies, we both loved movies -- as a matter of fact, I hate to admit it but on a rainy day we went to see four movies and only paid for one, but we would bake cookies together, and she loved the holidays, and she would decorate the house and I didn't have to do anything.  She just kind of, like, took over.  So she did come out of it a little bit.  She had suffered a rape at a concert, that was another thing that compounded her issues.  I think the thing that her -- the worst part for her was that this was a man that was supposed to be the best in his field.  He was supposed to help her.  He was supposed to help her heal.  But he didn't.  He abused her.  He sexually abused her, and he had the audacity to do that while I was sitting right there in the room.  I know that the other girls have similar stories.  We all have the same story, but for my daughter it just became a serious, serious bought of depression, and so in  she took her own life because she couldn't deal with the pain anymore, and it will be ten years in March that I lost my baby.  She was  years old.  She would have been  now.  And every day I miss her.  Every day.  And it all started with him.  It all started with him.  It just became worse as the years went by until she couldn't deal with it anymore.  And you don't know what it's like to be at work and get a call to come home immediately, and you know, a mother's instinct tells you something is wrong, and you pull up in your driveway and the medical examiner is there and your daughter is in a body bag and they're loading her into the van.  It has destroyed our family.  We used to be so close.  My husband and I -- I went through four years of intense therapy trying to deal with all of this until I could finally accept the fact that this was not my fault.  It was the fault of Larry Nassar that started all this with my daughter, and as you can see, she turned into a beautiful young lady who was really, really sick.  And that's my story for her.

A child is just what I was, a  year old who didn't see the world as a terrifying place, not until I was faced with the life changing experience that stole my innocence far too young.  Not until the day that you, Mr. Nassar, violated the right to be called a doctor and took something from I and all of the other strong women that stand behind me today. I was in a state of great desperation when I paid my visit to Doctor Nassar, or as he liked his patients to refer to him, Larry.  Prior to my visit I had been recommended by gymnastic coaches.  I heard words such as, you'll love him.  He's a miracle worker.  He can fix anyone or anything.  Thinking back to these words filling my naive mind, all I can think of is how this man, someone who held so many high credentials, was the monster who left me with more pain and scars than I came to his office with, the pain of never trusting someone physically again and the scars of being touched and exposed in places that were completely inappropriate.  That day in the office is a day that will never be forgotten.  My family and I drove from Naperville, Illinois, to Mr. Nassar's office at the Michigan State facility in Lansing, Michigan.  I can't begin to explain the feeling I had moments after this immoral act had been performed.  I got a moment to myself after the assault when I sat in the bathroom at the facility.  I sat there in great disbelief, complete shock, and total humiliation.  I couldn't fathom the idea of what had just occurred.  There isn't a day that goes by since July st, , that I don't cringe at the disturbing violation that this man had put me through.  This horrific headline had finally reached the media three years later of too many girls losing something that should have never been stolen; innocence, privacy, safety, and trust.  One day about three weeks after this had initially hit the news I was sitting in English class and we were discussing the meaning of the word depravity.  This word means wickedness or performing immorally corrupt acts.  The example my English teacher gave to further explain this disturbing word was this.  One day about -- excuse me.

I sat in my desk shaking as if I was back in that office being violated.  I previously described how this event stole my innocence, and that is what carries with me to this day.  For years I was afraid to give myself and my trust to anyone.  I wasn't willing to be heard again.  I had tried to hold on to every bit of innocence I felt I had left.  I was terrified to date anyone because I knew that physically and mentally I couldn't get past this internal barrier.  I was afraid to lose myself to another person who didn't deserve it.  Last year I found someone who took me in and handled me with great care.  I learned to trust his loving arms and appreciate the endless love he had for me despite my intimacy issues.  I finally feel as though I got my innocence back.  I gained back what I lost unexpectedly, and I'm grateful for that every day.  I'm speaking on behalf of all the girls who experienced this tragedy, whether it was one time or multiple times.  Once is far too much to be put through.  Some may be scared to share their experience.  I was.  I still am sometimes.  There are some days that this horrifying experience fills my brain and I can't think about anything else.  It left a mental scar that unfortunately will always be something that happened.  However, I am a strong believer that wounds heal into scars and these scars become stories that you share and heal from each day as time goes on.  A voice must be heard in order for all these victims of this tragic event to reach a level of closure.  Justice must be served.  I am speaking to all the parents out there, including my own, who could have been in the very room that this event happened but was manipulated into believing that Mr. Nassar was healing us, as any normal doctor is supposed to do.  You are not to blame.  I can tell you that the thought of, well, if my parents would have just done, has never crossed my brain, and I can speak of other daughters who experienced this as well.  To all the significant others of these girls, nothing means more to them than the way you love them and show them how to love themselves.  That is only going to help us heal, so thank you to both parents and significant others for going through these horrifying events with us and being there as a shoulder to cry on or a hand to squeeze tight.  To all the girls that have shown so much bravery throughout this, I could not be more proud of each and every one of you.  Although I may not know each of you personally, I can stand here and say that you are all my heroes.  Lastly, a few words to Mr. Larry Nassar.  You broke and shattered a lot of girls.  You manipulated us to trust you because you're a doctor and doctors do no wrong, only heal.  You are not a healer.  You performed acts of depravity just as my English teacher described.  You are also the one that must face what you have done for the rest of your life.  I am no longer broken by you.  Every day I grow a new strength and look into the mirror to see a strong, unbreakable person.  Nothing will ever take away what you have done to me or to the others that stand behind me.  However, we can walk free and radiate the strength that we have gained from your horrific acts, something you will never be able to do.  Although I no longer see the world through a child's eyes, I have become this powerful individual that is taking this opportunity to speak for what I believe in.  I am not the only one who suffered from these acts, and I know that this is not an easy thing to hear.  The fact of the matter is that it doesn't matter if this topic is uncomfortable to listen to or discuss.  It is something that happened and needs to be addressed,I am hopeful that this letter not only speaks to those in this room or those involved with this case but to anyone who hears of these headlines.  These acts were completely immoral and horrific and I am confident that Mr. Nassar will get what he deserves.  In the meantime, I hope that the effects that this tragedy has had on young girls is strong enough to make a change.  Initially when I was asked if I wanted to remain anonymous when I read my letter today I immediately thought, yes.  This is something about me that I have always been afraid to share with people.  I couldn't help but fear that people were going to look at my differently when this was nothing -- this was something that I did not ask to happen to me.  After thinking about it and taking time to cope with facing this fear of mine I decided to finally put a name to it.  I am Jade Capua, and I am a survivor.

       " \"  December , , I woke up from a nightmare sweating yet chilled to the core.  I knew before months of defending the mastermind I knew I was one of them.  That afternoon thousands of graphic images were found on multiple computers and media devices.  I still think about that daily.  For years Mr. Nassar convinced me that he was the only person who could help me recover from multiple serious injuries.  To me he was like a knight in shining armor.  But, alas, that shine blinded me from the abuse.  He betrayed my trust, took advantage of my youth, and sexually abused me hundreds of times.  For this I believe that Mr. Nassar deserves the maximum sentence for which his actions deserve.  As a nation we need to take control.  Sexual offenders need to know that they cannot continue with the crimes they are committing, and that no matter how long it takes for a survivor to come forward, their crimes will be exposed and their actions will be admonished.  Sexual assault and harassment should not be a part of our culture.  Mr. Nassar should never be allowed to look at, talk to, or touch another young person again.  I was an innocent nine year old with a broken pelvis that was willing to trust and allowed the doctor to do anything to help it feel better.  I had no reason not to.  He treated a few of my cousins.  He was friends with my mom and aunts.  He had pictures of Olympians and thank you notes from floor to ceiling in that MSU Sports Medicine office.  I gazed at them during every appointment.  I knew the story behind many of the portraits, he shared them with me.  I was the  year old preparing to go away to college, apprehensive, and just hoping my body would be able to withstand four more years of the sport that defined my life.  Ten years of abuse and neglect.  I don't like the word victim.  Being a victim implies the desire for pity.  I am a survivor, but more so, I am me, and those ten years are a part of my story.  They have helped to define who I am today.  Today I am more guarded than I was a year ago but I also am wiser and more aware.  Today it is my job to be an even better role model and mentor and to be an advocate in saying that this does not define the sport of gymnastics or the medical profession.  I have the honor of working with young girls every day.  They listen to what I say, get notifications every time I post to Instagram, analyze what I do, pick up on my vocabulary and copy how I dress.  It is my job to teach them to be humble and kind, strong willed and determined, gritty and confident.  It is my job to teach these girls that they can be the most powerful, amazing, and influential humans if they so choose and to help them realize that they have a voice and they have the ability to stand up for what they believe in.  It is my job to ensure that every nine year old I work with knows that she has an amazing future ahead of her and to ensure that every  year old I know realizes that she has the power to define who she is, that no // \",\n",

It is not my job to point out the flaws in the system and what others could have done to protect myinnocence.  That truth will one day be exposed.  But it is my job to make a difference and an impact on the world and to help stop monster-like humans from abusing their power.  I am working on forgiving you, Mr. Nassar.  One day I will be able to, but I will never forget what you have done.  I must ask you this, are you remorseful for your actions in all of the lives you have changed forever?  Do you regret misusing your medical dominance?  I could hear it in your voice that November day when you pled guilty.  You are sorry for the pain that you have caused.  You had the same sincerity as you told me the story of why you blame yourself for sweet ********** birth story, as you hugged me at your brother Mike's funeral, and all of those times you told me I just needed to rest and could not compete.  Saying that you did nothing for me would be a lie.  You helped to heal me.  My fragile bones, that is.  You shared your knowledge and gave me some invaluable advice, but you also abused your power and mytrust in you, and that is not okay.  My love for humanity is greater than the fear of the unknown.  My voice is louder than my inner thoughts.  My hope for change is more prevailing than my desire to ask why me, why was I the nine year old?  This past year I have had countless somber days and incredibly long sleepless nights.  I clenched my jaws as I heard strangers wonder how he really did what he did and turn the other way as I saw her face on the front page of the newspapers in the gas station.  I have held back tears when friends ask how I was holding up.  I have looked into my parents' hardened eyes, seeing their pain from now knowing that their only child was molested right in front of them in the same room.  When no one is around I have cried and sobbed, felt a rush of every emotion and solidified my belief that I have the most amazing family and an incredible circle of friends.  And I have had to think through and talk about the hundreds, hundreds of appointments and Nassar home visits and cringe at all of the times I should have said something about the improper treatments and oath breaking moments.  But I didn't, and I cannot look back anymore.  I am determined to be more involved in making this world a better place.  I can use my voice, my education, and my experiences to help stop females and males alike for not standing up for themselves and others.

I can still remember the feeling of disbelief last October when I realized that what I had thought was medical treatment over ten years ago was actually sexual abuse.  This case has taken all of me, every ounce of my being to press forward.  The world that we live in does not allow time to heal, and it never will.  Life continues to come at lightening speed.

       " \" AMdone.  My children and my husband get less than my best due to the many sleepless nights and layered days of scratching and clawing to stay afloat.  Prior to realizing what you had done to me I was a woman who once woke up each day with a smile, positive attitude, and end the day with just enough leftover energy to play with my children and successfully put a mark on another day.  I gave humans the benefit of earning my trust and most often took the time to see good in most people The past year has been nothing like those times.  My days start with exhaustion from a less than restful night's sleep and they end with fatigue from all the distractions and emotions that fill each day.  I have always believed that I can accomplish whatever life throws my way with a restful night's sleep, and I cannot sleep because of what you have done.  I have made jokes in the past saying that I've never witnessed a bad's night sleep and for that I was forever grateful for God giving me the ability to sleep soundly.  Over the last year I have cried more nights than not and I have experienced flashback nightmares of the abuse.  I've woken up from such bad nightmares that I vomit.  The anxiety this has caused me is what leaves me feeling like there is nothing more to give.  Today I am a mother, a wife, a daughter, and friend that is struggling each day to find peace and joy in all things that once made me happy.  Conversations are overtaken by Larry Nassar and the obvious pain in my voice is hard to avoid.  Those that truly know me know I will never be the same.  November of last year I began seeing a therapist for what I now know is post-traumatic stress disorder.  My deepest pain and fear was the thought of my two young daughters ever being hurt like this.  The fear that invoked was crippling.  I was unable to send my children to daycare due to the paralyzing anxiety I was experiencing.  And birthday parties, sleep-overs, large crowds of people steal the joy of creating memories with my family.  Some day I will have to explain to my children why I am the way I am, my reasons for being cautious and fearful.  My career has suffered tremendously from the distractions and the pain I am feeling.  There's not a day that passes that I don't think about the monster that created this mess.  The checklist of what needs to get done has never been harder to accomplish and some days the details seem like a nearly impossible task.  My mind is full of what is my new reality and my heart is aching from not being able to trust anybody around me.  For the past year I've held back with those that I love most.  I have become withdrawn from my every day life.  Life seems to be moving at a speed that I cannot keep up with and my peace of mind is forever taken away.  I will always sacrifice myself as a parent.  I went from once trusting full-heartedly to now not being able to trust at all.  The hardest battle I will continue to face is even in the situations you feel most safe, you can never let your guard down.  If you can't trust a world-renowned doctor, who in this world can you trust?  These feelings don't just stop from the abuse of Larry Nassar.  As if the struggle of what Larry Nassar did isn't bad enough, it's horrifying that MSU and USA Gymnastics are not stepping up to the plate to admit their wrongdoing.  I have gone from a raving fan of MSU to now seeing green and white in the very same way as I do Larry Nassar.  I want MSU and USAG to know what they have done is on the very same level of accountability as the crime Nassar has committed.  I strongly believe that MSU and USAG's inaction places an accountability on them for Nassar's access to minors which led to sexual abuse.  MSU knew what was being done to these athletes and decided to turn a blind eye to keep their reputation strong and their pockets full.  If they would have only taken action upon the reporting, they would have saved me and all of these other women standing before us today from an afterlife full of pain and agony.  As to what we now know of USAG, paying out to keep quiet is beyond my wildest dreams of wrong.  Shame on you for looking the other way when this was brought to your attention.  I'd like to take a moment to comment on MSU Board of Trustees as well as the president of MSU, Lou Anna Simon.  How convenient that you decided not to attend today.  You are a coward and your decision to watch from the sidelines is perfect representation of your lack of leadership.

Have you ever thought to pick -- oh, sorry.  It would only make sense for you to speak directly to the victims to seek a better understanding of what had happened.  Not once have you reached out to gather information or to ask how we are doing.  We see how you're handling this matter, and I can tell you from a mother's experience that I expect better effort from my two young children.  A public apology after you hid behind this monster for over  years will never be enough.  Where were you when we needed you?  If you would have only listened to all the women that brought complaints and concerns over all these years this would have saved so many children and women from being abused and from all the scars this has created.  You have apologized for him and for the horrible things he has done.  That is not enough.  At what point will you look at yourselves in the mirror and realize that taking ownership of this matter is the only way to truly bring about change.  Until then, I will continue to fight for real answers.  Lou Anna Simon and the board of trustees, all the signs were there.  The complaints should have been enough for you to open your eyes and ears and to ensure that there was intentional follow through involved to protect the women under your care.  You failed all of us, and for that I see you in the same category of criminal as I do the criminal standing before us today.  On the other hand, I am beyond grateful for the sentence Nassar received.   painful years of prison life surely brings relief to me.  Knowing you will never have the opportunity to hurt another human being is reassuring.  As for the people at MSU and USAG, just know we will continue to fight to ensure that you're held accountable for not protecting young girls under your care from this day forward.   brings newness for myself and my family.  Even though I will never be the same, I will continue to fight for trust, love, and, most of all, peace of mind.  I will slowly but surely begin to feel, to feel the joy of new experiences with my children, reconnect with friends who over the last year have gotten less than my best.  I will make strides to love with an untainted heart that is ready for new beginnings.  The pain will never fully pass from what you and the irresponsible organizations have done to myself and many others.  There's still so much uncertainty in life, but one thing is for sure, I will continue to press forward to seek what was once happiness.  I will educate my children about monsters like you and pray to God they will never experience pain like this.  There will be a day when I look into my soul and I will still see the scars of this nightmare, but I will no longer feel the deepness of your pain.  The scars will remind me that the past is real but the future is bright.  Thank you.  THE COURT\",\n",

       " \"  Not playing was not an option, and my parents were obviously concerned, and through my mom's connections with MSU I was able to get an appointment with Larry.  I saw Larry once.  I remember him doing a scan on my body as I stood straight up in his office where he poked and prodded at me and he made various observations about my muscles and bone structure, et cetera.  My mom was in the room.  I was really into sports and, honestly, it was interesting to hear such a thorough examination of my body.  After the standing examination was done Larry asked me to lay down on the exam table and he positioned himself so that he was between my midsection and where my mom was sitting so she couldn't see what was happening.  He kept prodding at and manipulating my legs and hips and stomach and at some point he said he was going to move his hands close to my vagina.  I've thought a lot about that statement in hindsight and I see now how devious and how practiced it must have been for him.  My mom knew this doctor would be getting close so no cause for concern, and I was expecting something to happen but I didn't know what.  I had absolutely no other medical or personal experience against which to compare what he was about to do, and he didn't talk me through what he was doing, so he molested me and he molested me with my mom in the room.  My mom and I talked about the appointment afterwards but I didn't really have the words for what Larry had done, and as a  year old girl I was embarrassed to talk to adults about something like that.  I had never seen a gynecologist.  I never had a pap smear, and at the time I thought this is what it meant to be a woman going to the doctors, awkward and embarrassing and uncomfortable but just part of the deal.  Besides, I thought he was looking out for me.  It's been about  years since my appointment, and in that  years I have never had another health professional come close to touching me the way that he did.  At the time I had a sense that it was a strange appointment and if the university or police or someone actually looking to find something had asked either my mom or I about the experience, they would have put together a pattern of him acting far outside of normal behavior for a doctor, but no one asked us, and so after me, Larry had another  odd years to molest and assault young women and girls.

I knew that Larry Nassar molested me when I read the article in the IndyStar.  This last year and a half is about coming to terms with how naive and vulnerable I was.  I feel very stupid for not understanding what was happening at the time, really guilty for not contributing in some way to stop it sooner, and really, really emotional and vulnerable, but I also feel really lucky because I got to go through high school and I got to go through college and dating and I got to meet my future husband only thinking it was a weird doctor's appointment.  It's just in the last year that I've had to come to terms with what happened, but even in the last year it has changed me.  Larry's later victims knew they were victims at a much younger age so beyond molesting them, as you heard today, he's also robbed them of the innocence and carefree-ness that's supposed to come with that time in our life.  After today I don't plan to think about Larry unless I absolutely have to.  I get to keep living.  I get to keep looking forward to the future and what's next.  I get to keep having an incredibly rich and fulfilling life, and so do the other women who are here today, and so do the other women who haven't necessarily stepped forward, but that's not what he gets, and that's where I get my justice.  I'd like Larry to sit in prison for a very long time with no hope for what's next.I also want to say I was abused once a long time ago.  I did not understand it was abuse until I was an adult, and even with that, this past year has still been a very emotional and trying time.  I can't imagine how difficult it's been for the charging victims.  I don't want the women and families who testified against Larry to have to go through that again unless they want to, which is why I hope that even though these crimes warrant a lifetime or more in prison, you sentence Larry to the highest minimum of  years so that the plea deal is not jeopardized.And I also want to close by saying thank you to you, to Detective Andrea Munford, to Rebekah Snyder, Angela Povilaitis, to Rachael and IndyStar for shining a light on this and for the other women who stepped forward to end the abuse.

I am relieved that the truth finally came out, but I am angry with myself for not recognizing the abuse sooner, and I struggle with that daily.

Having to relive my experiences over and over almost  years later brings back so many memories and emotions.  I even avoid talking to -- talking about it with those close to me because I get closed off and irritable.  The fact that I was sexually abused by you is something that I'm still wrapping my head around.  One of the hardest parts is seeing my parents carry any sense of responsibility for what happened because it is in no way their fault.  It's your fault.  We all trusted Larry and are angry for the way you deceived us.  He's made it difficult to trust anyone.  The flashbacks of the hours spent alone in that exam room with him have at times kept me up at night.  My memories are vivid and it's hard to get images out of my head.  I remember how much it hurt but didn't want to speak up because I was afraid of what you would think of me.  I had to be strong.  When I told my mom that it hurt, she thought I was referring to the pain in my back, not the pain in my vagina from the excruciating hours of assault that just took place.  For the first time in my life I sought therapy because I've realized this is something that I am not able to deal with on my own.  My therapist has helped me find ways to cope with my anxiety and emotions, but, more importantly, she's helped me to stop blaming myself.  Larry, you are the one that should feel guilt and shame every day and have to live with that for the rest of your life.  Unfortunately, we as victims and survivors have to live with the damage you have caused for the rest of our lives, too.  Your Honor, I'm asking for the full sentence set by the Attorney General's office because I am a hundred percent confident that if he had not been caught, he would continue to do this for the rest of his life.

I talked with my parents and sister and thought the women that reported the sexual assault must be mistaken.  Even though I did not know this at the time, I had also gone through the same abuse beginning when I was  years old.  Today I know I was in the first stage of grief, denial.  Denial that I could ever be a victim of sexual assault.  I was grieving that a person I respected and cared for had betrayed my trust, grieving the realization that I was sexually assaulted as a child.  Prior to and even after my unfortunate contact with Larry Nassar I thought of myself as someone that was good at reading people.  However, Larry Nassar is a master manipulator.

       " \" AMPage  to  of  of  sheetsappointments as a minor.  After discovering the assault had taken place, my family and I were distraught with grief.  My mom blamed herself and felt she should have asked more questions and been more guarded and skeptical about procedures.  The thought of my mom hurting and blaming herself was heartbreaking for me because never once did I think it was her fault.  Anyone that has suffered sexual assault or loves someone who has needs to realize it's not their fault.  It is the sexual predator's fault, and in this case it is Larry Nassar's fault.  Even though I accepted this abuse was out of my control to prevent, it has not lessened my depression and anxiety.  There are nights I lie awake crying, fearful of the nightmares that may come when I fall asleep, and when I'm awake the nightmare of this reality, my reality, is not much better.  Not only am I depressed with the realization of what happened to me, I've had to go on living my same life with family and friends that have no idea what I'm going through.  Usually I'm a very outgoing and open person, but it's been difficult to be my true self without sharing this part of my past.  What motivates me to come forward is my strong belief that victims of sexual assault deserve to have a voice.  By publicly speaking out against Larry Nassar I'm not just speaking out for myself, I'm speaking out for all the girls and women of the past, present, and future that have been or will be affected by sexual assault A quote from Jasmin Kaur\",\n",
       " \"  Scream so that one day a hundred years from now another sister will not have to dry her tears wondering where in history she lost her voice.  It's been a difficult road, to say the least, but I know in my heart our efforts will help women not only today but for years to come.  Difficult times can either strengthen or break a person.  I am proud to say that this experience, though extremely challenging and sometimes unbearable, has made me a stronger woman than I was before.  Through this strength I have learned to not be ashamed.  The only ones that should be ashamed are Larry Nassar and the institutions that enabled him and denied responsibility.  I am thankful to the women that spoke out before me and gave me the courage to publicly share myname today.  I am no longer ashamed of speaking out, I am proud to.  It is disgraceful that it has taken this long for these girls and young women to have a voice and for that voice to be taken seriously.  It sickens meto know that over  years ago this abuse, my abuse, could have been avoided.  However, no one took the accusations seriously, or worse yet, no one cared.  Due to the shameful negligence and indifference of Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics, myself and  plus girls and young women were sexually assaulted and abused by Larry Nassar.  Although being a part of this case and publicly speaking my truth are actions I'm very proud of, my life would have been much easier if Larry Nassar was never a part of it.  If he was charged and convicted two decades ago it would have saved myself, the other victims, and all of our families and loved ones from immense amounts of pain and suffering that will now carry with us the rest of our lives.  To the pain and lifelong impact the defendant has imposed on myself, my family, my loved ones, and so many others, I feel that Larry Nassar should receive the maximum sentence.

       " \"  Your Honor, Mr. Nassar sexually abused me over a number of years beginning when I was a young teenager.  He broke me.  He stole my innocence and exploited it for his own sick satisfaction.  All aspects of my young life was torn apart.  I struggled in silence, shame, and confusion attempting to put the pieces of my life back together, but I will never be whole again.  The pain of the abuse continues to make me feel broken, insecure, fearful, and overall worthless.  At times these feelings become completely overwhelming that I engage in self destructive behavior and thought about killing myself. Feeling worthless is an extremely difficulty emotion to describe.  I would like you to imagine a time you turned off all the lights in a room and it was pitch black for a few moments before your eyes adjusted.  Feeling worthless is like that pitch blackness but your eyes never adjust.  You are just stuck in the darkness, a dark and empty space, and the more you search for any kind of light, the deeper you go into the desolate, apathetic, and fearful trap the darkness created.  You blame yourself for not being able to pull yourself out of the darkness and, therefore, feeling -- a feeling of worthlessness increases.  For other individuals their eyes would adjust or they would eventually find a light.  This is not the case for me since this pitch blackness is in my mind and the darkness has grown and entailed itself in every facet of my life.  I have tried to fight back against this darkness to feel worthwhile and worthy.  From others' perspectives I may seem like hardened and accomplished.  I have achieved so much.  In  I graduated from undergrad.   I graduated with my first master's degree, and  with my second master's degree.  Then in  I graduated with my doctorate, but I never once felt worthy of my accomplishments.  I never walked during commencement because I'm not worthy of the praise, congratulations, and pageantry of such a ceremony.  I have previously engaged in self harming behaviors.  I have stayed in abusive relationships when I knew deep down that I should run long before I did run.  I have had good relationships that never lasted since I did not feel worthy of the honest and true love that was offered.  I was stuck in the pitch blackness even though the other person was trying so hard to turn on the lights.  The physical damage has also been monstrous.  In just the last four and a half years I have had three major back surgeries and too -- too many steroid injections and nerve ablations to count.  These real medical procedures were in the same area of my back that Mr. Nassar was supposed to be treating.  Because of Mr. Nassar's complete lack of empathy and caring for my physical well-being, I still feel unworthy of a pain-free life or at least a life with minimal pain.  What I have described is just a brief overview of my life.  To give you more context, Your Honor, the past year and few months have been the most difficult and trying time of my life as the sexual abuse resurfaced with even more intensity, and I have constantly relived the abuse.  Because of this I had to resign from my job as I fell deeper into depression and no longer wanted to live.  I was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and still suffer from nightmares, intrusive thoughts, anxiety, depression, hypervigilance, and much more.  I spent  days in a trauma treatment center as my symptoms could not be controlled with outpatient counseling.  After I received the treatment I desperately needed I had to move and restart my career and whole life from scratch.  The stress of constantly reliving the years have impacted my physical health.  I have stomach problems where I can barely eat anything on some days.  I have been hospitalized multiple times for back and chest pain and I developed a heart arrhythmia that has to be surgically corrected.  Even though I'm doing much better, I still have days where I call my mom crying, have difficulty socializing, and lack motivation to do anything.  Your Honor, may I now address the defendant?

Each one of us had a full life ahead of us and we are full of potential and possibilities.  This is one of the things that I find unique about this situation.  You were considered the best, and as a result of that, everyone that saw you had the utmost potential.  They came from loving, supporting families that were doing everything in their power to support them.  These kids had dreams, the means to achieve them, and were fighting tooth and nail to reach them.  They were the cream of the crop.  What you did altered critical parts of our growth into being healthy adults.  What you did has made us second-guess our own inner voice, our gut reactions, and our ability to have accurate perceptions of people.  You put massive obstacles in between us and greater happiness in our lives, having healthy romantic relationships, and having trust for others who truly want to -- truly want to help us.  You hindered the trajectories of our lives that we and our parents worked so very hard for and changed the rest of our lives in ways that we're still realizing and dealing with every day.  This is what makes this crime so heinous, the cost is so high and the damage is complicated and impossible to measure.  You did this to countless human beings over decades.  Most of our victims probably aren't aware of everything you did and what you're being held accountable for today.  Not many people look up their doctors they saw  years ago or  or  or five years ago.  I only found out because of a fluke.  I often wondered what the number of victims really is.  The number of people whose lives you altered does not stop with the victims.  It has also impacted the people closest to us in our lives.  We have no choice but to watch them suffer from this too.  Our mothers and fathers who wanted the best for us, our spouses and partners, our friends, all of us with so many people, for what?  More recently the price that the bravest of us had to have paid to get this out in the open.  They've had to publicly attach you and what you did to them to their names.  Every time someone Googles them, possibly for the rest of our lives, they will see the sickening things we're talking about here today; when they apply for a job, when they go on a first date.  They won't be able to be the ones to fully make the choice on when to talk to their kids about what happened to them.  This terrible part of their past is exposed to all.  In spite of this, they have spent so much time and energy to get to this day and prevent this from happening to others.  The strength of character that these people have shown is in stark contrast to who you've shown yourself to be.  To each and every person who has worked to get to this day, I sincerely thank you from the bottom of my heart.  I also thank everyone who has played a supportive role which really does make a world of difference.  I know our fight isn't over.  We're working to change the policies that allowed this behavior to span decades.  This type of crime is not new and the lack of policy to prevent it is inexcusable.  It is simply negligence.  If people -- if policy to prevent this was in place and was followed, it would have prevented this from happening to the majority of us.  Whistleblowers need to be taken seriously.  Reporting needs to be mandatory and documented, and this part is not difficult to figure out.  Policymakers have the power to prevent this.  They need to know this.

A name with a name whose name will forever haunt me as the man who took something from me but can never be forgotten.  You took something from me that can never be replaced, can never be changed, can never be forgiven, and that was my youth and innocence.  You took advantage of me when I was most vulnerable, when I was most afraid, and when I was most trusting.  You manipulated me into believing that everything you did was okay, that I was supposed to trust you, and I was supposed to never question anything you did because you were a doctor.  And because you were my doctor, you took advantage of me.  You stripped me of my dignity, my youth, and my trust, all for your personal satisfaction.  Because of your actions my life has forever changed.  I have to live with the fact that I was a victim of sexual assault.  I was a victim of sexual assault by someone I trusted and by someone who was supposed to help me achieve my passions in life, but instead you physically and emotionally abused me.  I have to live with the consequences every single day for the rest of my life while you never once thought about how your actions would affect the innocent women you decided to take advantage of for your personal pleasure.  My childhood has forever been scarred while it should have been the happiest of times.  I have lost all trust in medical professionals because of your actions.  I have lost my dignity as a young woman, and I have lost trust in many relationships throughout my life because of something that happened when I was only  years old.  You have darkened one of my greatest passions in life, gymnastics, and it will forever be tied to your name.  Your name that will forever be remembered as a gymnastics doctor that abused and sexually assaulted me as a young woman.  As my life goes on and your life ends in prison, I hope that you will realize that your actions have not only affected my life but also all of the other brave women who have came forward.

However, in November when I sat at home with my hands shaking while watching the live feed in the first hearing you presided over I heard the most interesting, powerful words come from your mouth.  You said that you wanted every girl to heal and you would let us take as long as we needed to all come forward and speak out.  That gave me the courage to face the fact that I was abused by Larry Nassar at the Michigan State University Sports Medicine Clinic for many years as I came to him for medical help for my gymnastics injuries. I decided I wanted to have the courage to step forward and fully have this experience today so that I could heal and gain freedom and have closure from this confusing chapter of my life.  So, first of all, I want to thank you for having the foresight and the compassion to make this happen for all of us today.  THE COURT',\n",

What else would you like me to know?  VICTIM \",\n",
       " \"  For those of you here listening today, I am remaining anonymous because that gives me the peace of mind that I need right now, but as I stand here before you, Larry Nassar, I know that I am not anonymous to you.  You once knew me so well.  You knew my voice, my face, my body in ways that you should have never been allowed to know.  You knew everything about me.  Up until just a few years ago you were a confidant.  You were my close friend who always had my best interests in mind, whether it is about my injuries, my eating habits, my gymnastics practices, school choices, college decisions, career path, and all the way up to my family plans.  I know now that this is one of the surefire signs of a friendly sexual predator.  I know now that the word grooming is a bad word, a word that I should never had to research as an adult woman.  When I was young I did not recognize that the grooming you were up to for more than a decade with me was to manipulate me to allow yourself further access to my body, to take advantage of me for your own selfish pleasure.  Even though I tried to stop you many times, you continually established trust with me so you could continue to hurt me.  I had no idea that you took my love for gymnastics and my desire to stay out of pain and you used it against me.  I sometimes think if I can tell my younger self how much I was loved and valued when I was only  and when it all began while receiving treatment from Larry Nassar, then maybe I would have never been tricked into a friendship and support from a doctor that I thought really cared about my well-being with all of his heart.  But that is not the case here because it wouldn't have mattered in what state of confidence I ever was because he was a master at manipulating the situation to feed his selfish addiction of taking advantage of me any time he could.  I completely trusted him  percent.  I never questioned why he always asked the nurses or residents to leave the room even though he was known as a teaching doctor and it would have made much more sense for them to stay in the room to learn his techniques.  But those techniques were a facade to feed his addiction, and because of that, I have dealt with questioning every person that I have ever met.  I questioned that they had true intentions, and I never learned to really trust the actual trustworthy people in my life.  I am not confused any longer about his intentions.  I now understand that he had a lifetime  of  sheetsPage  to  of // \",\n",
       " '',\n",
       " ' AMcareer of hurting that he disguised as wanting to genuinely help.  I might believe that he could have had an ounce of good to his soul because I knew him so well, but he let his sinful and selfish desires take over his soul and his whole existence and he fell into the trap of extreme selfishness, not just for the hundreds of instances he took advantage of me but for so many other gymnasts, women, and girls.  Although his actions have affected my whole life and especially my health and my confidence, I am choosing to move forward and choosing to use the awful pain of this to grow stronger as a woman and daughter of God.  First Peter ',\n",
       " \" says, And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his internal glory in Christ, he himself will restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you.  I did, however, deal with a sense of guilt only due to the fact that I previously thought that if I would have spoken up more or louder then somebody would have listened at Michigan State University.  But I did tell a coach while on my gymnastics team at MSU and Kathie chose to put Larry's name, her identity, and the university's reputation above the choice to protect me.  My concerns and fears were minimized by those in authority positions at MSU, but now I don't have to carry that guilt any longer.  I was child.  I did my best, and I did speak up.  Even if I said it louder or more often, it wouldn't have mattered because we can see now that many girls and women spoke to people in authority at MSU and they were not heard.  This is so devastating.  This is a miscarriage of justice.  May we all learn from this that if a child ever comes to us about any type of unusual feeling coming from any adult, we will never brush them off.  We will listen to their every word and we will show them that we care and that we want to help them by taking immediate action for them.  May our state, our community, and especially our university learn from this horrible sequence of mistakes that children should be protected always and at all costs.  We have to find the positive.  Larry Nassar's actions and MSU's negligence will be the reason for a change in a society filled with secrets and confusion.  Because of the brave women and girls and friends and parents and family members that are here today that have stepped forward to bring truth and light to this dark secret, we will now see a change.  We will know how to recognize a person of extreme status and high caliber can also be one that causes extreme hurt and trauma and is utterly dangerous with repercussions that last a lifetime.  I believe the real tragedy here is not just that one man was extremely sinful in nature but that MSU did not have the proper checks and balances in place.  They somehow managed to glorify a criminal and ignore the signs.  Instead of private investigations, myself and several other girls were told by the MSU staff that we were wrong.  We grew up watching MSU promote and glorify a child pedophile.  MSU enabled, paid, and promoted him to live out these terrible acts.  We were repeatedly shut down with our attempts of stopping this man.  As I am now a mother, I can say that there is absolutely no excuse for this.  Regardless of how insignificant a child's plea for help may have seemed by MSU, I don't understand how this history could have went on for more than two decades.  These are the answers that I demand.  This is the change that needs to happen right here in our community so that growth will happen at other institutions.  If all of us survivors' pain and suffering prevents and protects other children, then it will not be wasted.  I have freedom not to be afraid anymore.  I will be free from the chains of control from a man that will never have access to me or any girl ever again.  And I am free from worrying what will happen to Larry Nassar.  His actions have caught up to him and God will deal with him now for what he sees best.  I believe he needs the maximum sentence for his actions and so that future predators will remember this story and choose to stop violating children and get help.  The truth is out and we can use this truth to overcome evil and make sure these things will never happen again.  For all of those that covered for him, enabled him, or turned the other way while I saw him at Michigan State University, I hope your actions will come to light and you can come out with the truth to make our university and community a safer place for children and women.  And if you choose not to, I know at some point your actions, too, will catch up with you.  Our God is a just God and he will bring mercy and healing to all of us that need it.

You will be stronger every single day as defendant gets weaker, and you can rest assured knowing that, and I think your message is especially important because if I take your words together, what I hear is that you are asking that people, especially children, come before sports and that the people, especially the children, are not a backseat in sports but a front seat consideration before anything else, and it shouldn't be just in sports but in all life, but, of course, we know here defendant was a sports doctor -- I don't want to use the term, I know it upsets everyone, he's no longer a doctor but at that point.

It wasn't until last year when coming home for the holidays and reading the IndyStar article that I fully realized what happened.Through the entire time I was seeing him I was told by multiple people in his office and my pediatrician's office that he was the best and he would be my best shot of not being in pain anymore so I assumed from there that anything that happened was medically necessary.  Prior to this time I was a tenaciously confident, adventurous, and free-spirited girl who thrived in leadership roles on my soccer, cross country team, and in choirs and musicals.

       " \"  Unlike most of the women in this room who were and are accomplished gymnasts, when I was a teenager I was an elite vocalist and I would spend most of my time in different choirs, ensembles, and musicals, solo competitions, and eventually being recruited to sing for Michigan State.  One of the biggest things I believe to change during this time is I began to become afraid of my own ability to write and to perform.  I believe that through the confusion and self disgust I felt for repeatedly -- from what repeatedly happened to me I slowly lost the certainty I had in my ability and my passion for being on stage and for writing music.  I could no longer handle the vulnerability it took to perform on a regular basis.  By the time I turned  the only performing I did was bar singing in which I could use alcohol as a sedative for my nerves, and I haven't been able to finish writing a song since I was .  In addition to taking some of my love of music it is because of Larry and his misuse of trust that I stopped playing soccer.  Soccer was always my favorite sport and the sport I was most talented in.  When I began seeing Larry in  he sent me to get a bone scan in which he told me it came back showing a stress fracture in my lower spine.  I was to wear a back brace for much of that year.  He used my stress fracture as the reason to tell me I needed to continue seeing him, stop playing soccer, and that my back was too fragile, and with the right slide tackle I would end up paralyzed.  I put full trust in him, as you generally would a doctor who was told was the best, and stopped playing soccer.  When getting my medical results for this legal process I found the statement no fracture is seen in multiple place from other doctors in my medical file.  It is incredibly angering to realize the sport that I love beyond words was taken from me for a reason that I now believe was completely false and only used to keep me as a patient for his personal gain.  In addition to not playing soccer throughout the last  years due to false information, I also lived my life more cautiously believing that my body was more fragile than it was.  Another one of the things that I feel Larry has taken from me is my sense of self confidence and assurance in my own ability, judgment, and physical strength.  I worked hard to accomplish many things throughout my life but I've since struggled to be proud or share what I accomplished with others.  Not only does this hurt me on a personal level but has been an issue looking for employment.  I often cower to the ideas of male co-workers, especially supervisors, or avoid being put in a position where I would have to work in close proximity with men, sometimes even leaving positions when I feel like it is too much.  Instead of taking opportunities to work late, when I often know it would just be me and male co-workers in the building, I leave immediately, often to the effect of being behind in my work so that I am never alone.  This has gotten exponentially worse over the last year after reliving everything through an adult's eyes.  For the last  years I have struggled with trust and intimacy with others.  Generally it takes me a long time to fully trust anyone and possibly years before I really share anything truly emotional and vulnerable about myself, which I used to do regularly and took a lot of pride as an artist to do so.  Physical touch has since been a huge problem for me.  I get anxiety before large family events and holidays knowing that I will most likely be touched and hugged by those I love.  Something that should be joyful and relaxing is often anything but.  When touched unexpectedly even by those closest to me like my husband, my initial reaction is defensive and it takes a while for my nervous system to calm down.  In addition to the anxiety being brought on by touch, I often feel a lot of guilt and self loathing for being so guarded and unloving to those closest to me.  In the last year since the news broke I had to come to terms with a lot of what exactly happened to me  years ago, and I lost a lot of trust in those around me.  Aside from close friends, I've had a year of avoiding conversation, touch, sharing what is going on in my life.  I often find myself replaying horrible flashbacks in my head trying to make sense of it all.  It has caused a lot of anxiety, depression, recurrent nightmares, and a lack on my personal relationships.  One of the major issues that has occurred // \",\n",
       " '',\n",
       " \" AMPage  to  of  of  sheetsrecently is that I have -- I have always had anxiety when being around male doctors but it has gotten exponentially worse, and as someone who has gone through infertility testing and currently pregnant, it becomes exhausting to have to constantly advocate to have a female doctor and explain why it's necessary when somebody doesn't take you seriously.  If I'm unable to see a female physician, I generally have intense anxiety leading up to and during the exam.  For example, a couple months ago I had gone in for an HSG test and was only able to get a male doctor.  They allowed me to have two young techs with me at the time, but I had so much anxiety having a gynecological procedure done by a male, between that and the pain, I passed out on the table almost immediately after it started.  My heart rate and blood pressure were so low the office had to call my husband to come get me.  It is ridiculously embarrassing to have to take extreme precaution for my medical care.  I generally thrive in high stress situations and intentionally work in such, but when it comes to my own medical care, the simplest issue is paralyzing.  It has also made the process of making a birth plan with my hospital unnecessarily very complicated and I fear what the added anxiety from this case and what I live with day-to-day will do to my daughter.  I have also lost a lot of the love I had for coming back to my hometown and the passion I always held for being a Spartan.  Coming back to East Lansing has always been a fun and exciting time for me.  I see friends and everything.  And even though we live out of state, it was important for my husband and I to come back to campus and be married there, but it has now turned into reliving what happened to me years before the entire time.  I no longer look forward to spending my weekends watching sports with friends, which has always been a large pastime of mine and has been a hobby since I was young Overall this trauma has caused me a great deal of depression, anxiety, recurrent nightmares, intimacy issues, loss of enjoyment in loved activities, issues at work, feelings of guilt, shame, low self esteem and self worth, and occasional suicidal thoughts.  It has caused feelings of guilt and depression in my family members, especially my mother who knows this has to do with the pain that she was in the room at the time, and added unnecessary strain on my closest relationships.  These things that happened to me in his office long ago were not short-lived, uncomfortable moments.  They were lifelong traumas that has changed the way I walk in the world.  And if it's okay with you, I'd like to say something to Larry.  THE COURT\",\n",

In reference to something you said during your plea hearing, which I know other girls have referred to today, although I understand that you have the right to give a statement in defense of yourself, please know that I do not buy for one second what you said.

       " \"  Okay.  As for the details of myencounter with Nassar, unfortunately those are more difficult to forget.  A little history about me.  Though legally an adult at , I was still very much a kid when I came to Michigan State.  I left school, one, having kissed two boys and, two, armed with my dad's permission to punch anybody in the nose who tried to put his hands where he shouldn't.  Going in as a freshman I was pretty naive.  I was desperate to compete and I wanted to get better.  I was considered a star player coming out of high school and expectations were high for me when I first entered the program.  So when my performance was not up to par -- I sat on the bench first half of the season -- I felt like I was letting my team down so I worked harder, practiced more.  Just like everyone in this room, you want to get on the floor and compete.  The rigors of training began to take a toll on my body and I battled shoulder inflammation along with back and leg injuries.  I was highly motivated to heal and I wanted nothing more than to compete to mypotential for the benefit of my team.  Sports medicine was new to me so who was I to question it?  Growing up in my family you went to the doctor if, one, you were dying, two, you broke a bone, or, three, you were due for a checkup.  Other than my high school athletic trainer who occasionally iced and taped up my ankle, my experience with sports medicine doctors was obsolete at best.  We treated // \",\n",
       " '',\n",
       " \" AMPage  to  of  of  sheetsour sprained ankles, jammed fingers, and pulled muscles at home.  Coming under the care of sports medicine doctors was a new experience for me.  I was absolutely blown away by the program and how well they took care of their student athletes.  So here are the details of the incident as I remember them.  To the MSU volleyball team Doctor Nassar was jokingly referred to as the crouch doc for his unconventional methods of treating back and hip pain.  The buzz around Jenison Fieldhouse is that he was somewhat of a wizard, a nationally recognized doctor with great success in his field of expertise.  It seemed like the doctors at MSU were always in demand, especially Doctor Brumm and Doctor Nassar, so when I was squeezed in to see the doctor with the miracle treatments, I was very grateful.  Again, this was back when Jenison had medical trailers for a brief time because our training room didn't have adequate private space for doctors visits.  I remember having the option of keeping my Spandex on, which I was very grateful for and chose.  He had me lay down face down on the medical table.  When he started treatment I remember him saying his treatment relied upon applying pressure to areas around the pelvis and that this was normal, so when he went down there I just told myself it was normal, that he knows what he's doing, and don't be a baby.  I remember he first started with pressure -- excuse me.  Excuse me.  He first started with pressure points around the outside of my vagina and around my pubic bones.  He said he was trying to relieve pressure and something about nerve endings in that area being related to the back.  He would just ask me questions and talk about life, his work, and how he used this method to help some.  However, during the procedure I am now choosing to report, he just gradually moved in, pressing through and stretching my Spandex with his fingers as he entered through my vaginal opening.  I remember laying there wondering, is this okay?  This doesn't seem right.  Should I say something?  What's happening?  I didn't know what to do.  He just kept on talking about life like when you go to the dentist and they talk about random stuff to try to make you feel at ease.  He didn't say anything out of the ordinary, he just did it as though he was doing something as mindless as riding a bicycle.  There are two arguments at war in my mind, this doesn't seem right versus he's a world-renowned doctor and he's treated so many athletes.  Everyone knows he treats down there and they don't complain so just stop being a baby.  Everyone trusted him.  I told myself I needed to trust him, too, so I convinced myself it was just a normal part of the procedure and kept my mouth shut.  However, I could not have prepared myself for what happened next.  Originally I was very hesitant to share the details of this part.  I did not want to give Nassar or any other sexual predator the opportunity to relive any details but I think this is a huge problem in society today that there are people that are hesitant to speak up because they think a victim wanted to be assaulted.  And that's just not true.  So in my opinion this is the worst partAgain, growing up in a culture with little experience of my own, I assumed something like what happened to me would only happen if I wanted it to.  Now that I'm a grown woman with friends in the medical field, I know this is not true at all from a medical standpoint, but what I knew at the time was based on magazines, movies, culture, and other teens just joking about it.  To be clear, during that appointment Nassar put direct pressure on places I didn't know existed at the time and my body reacted.  I didn't want it to but it reacted anyways, and as it was happening I remember laying there frozen stiff on the table utterly mortified, confused, and scared.  I felt so powerless to control what was happening.  My mind was willing one thing, for it to stop, and my body was doing another thing, not stopping.  And all the time I had no idea whether or not he was aware of what was happening.  He just kept on with his treatment as if nothing had happened.  I didn't move until the treatment was over and then I tried my best to pretend nothing happened and left as quickly as I could.  The initial aftermath.  In the aftermath questions raced through my mind a mile a minute trying to make sense of it all.  What just happened?  Trying to desperately understand why I couldn't control what was happening to my body.  Could my body really react that way if I didn't want it to?  I thought that was impossible, but clearly it wasn't because it just happened.  If it's not supposed to happen like that, what does that say about me?  Was I sick or something?  Did I need help?  I felt like my body had just betrayed me, and I had built up such a wall of protection in my mind around Nassar that my first reaction was to question myself, to blame  of  sheetsPage  to  of // \",\n",
       " '',\n",
       " \" AMmyself.  I wanted to believe the best in people, but no matter how much I rationalized, he's a doctor, he's trying to help you, you should be grateful he's treating you, he didn't mean for it to happen, I couldn't shake the voice in my head that said something wasn't right.  But how could I tell someone?  I was so afraid if I told someone the truth that they would think I was lying, that they would think I was one of those athletes just looking to stir up trouble.  I was scared they would draw their own conclusions, they would believe the only way for my body to react in that manner was if I liked it, if I welcomed it, or if I wanted it.  I knew -- I was afraid that people would look at me differently.  I was fearful of being looked down upon, of being labeled.  I was fearful a man wouldn't want me after that.  That no man would want me.  People would think I was messed up.  I would be deemed unlovable, unacceptable, and what if what Doctor Nassar did was unintentional?  What if my body was just abnormal?  Again, I was young, inexperienced, and I didn't know there was a spot inside your body that triggered that type of response.  I feared the possibility of accusing an innocent man, that I could ruin a good doctor's reputation and career for performing a normal medical procedure.  He couldn't control how my body reacted, or could he?  Could what happen be some abnormal freakish side effect or something?  But what if it wasn't?  It was all so confusing, but in the end I decided to go to my trainer, Lianna, or Lili as we affectionately called her, and ask if there was a way for athletes to file a general complaint just stating that they were uncomfortable with their doctor's visit.  Again, all I wanted to do was say I'm uncomfortable and to have that heard and recorded with the small hope that I wasn't alone.  So when I came to her asking her if I could file a general complaint, she treated the situation with both seriousness and sober-mindedness and tried to walk me through the process the best way that she knew how.  She asked me all sorts of questions, did Nassar do something you thought was criminally wrong?  Did he hurt you?  I remember trying to answer as truthfully as possible, but I was so scared of revealing what I thought were shameful details that I didn't give her much to go on.  In the end, she wanted to make sure I correctly understood what filing a report would involve; an investigation, making an accusation against Nassar, and stating that I felt that he did something unprofessional or criminally wrong.  At the time I couldn't say I -- could I say that with certainty?  I had a hard time saying that with certainty.  I just wanted to say I was uncomfortable and have it recorded.  I wasn't aware of a way to do that without making a formal accusation and exposing those mortifying details to the world, so instead of filing a report, I came up with a plan for the future.  If I ever had to be treated by the doctor again, I would be forthright and clear.  If he tried to go there, I would speak up.  I would say I was uncomfortable, and I resolved in my mind if he proceeded to cross a boundary after that, I would drop kick him in the face.  Armed with this initial resolution, it just felt safer to move on.  I'm sorry, I'm breaking from this for a minute.  And then you come in here and you see all these beautiful, young women, these little girls -- I'll get to that later.  Just stick with it.  Go.  Okay.  So why am I now choosing to report this?  I didn't hear about the accusations against Doctor Nassar until the day after my birthday, which was April th of  -- what was last year?  MR. BEDFORD\",\n",

       " '  Thank you.  When I first heard about it my initial instinct was to send a group chat to my teammates.  I knew some had been treated by him, and I wanted to make sure no one was as oblivious as I was.  It sparked a conversation and I found myself once again faced with a decision to speak up.  Memories began to resurface and I found myself having to revisit the scenario once more again under different circumstances.  With a sexual experience of a woman married nearly  years and armed with the realization far more athletes had similar experiences to my own, I now find it very hard to believe that Doctor Nassar, as a recognized medical professional, did not know those spots were there and that he was unaware of the changes that were happening to me when I was lying face down on that medical table, so I called my church mentor, a physical therapist at Botsford Hospital in Metro Detroit, and through uncontrollable sobbing I began to painfully unearth and recollect the incident I had so decidedly buried years ago.  She was the first person I ever told.  Even // ',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " \" AMPage  to  of  of  sheetsarmed with the knowledge I was not alone, I could barely muster enough courage to share the details of myencounter with Nassar.  Gradually over the period of a few days I faced my fear, opened up to select friends, family, and my team about the incident.  The love and support I received from them has been overwhelming, especially from my husband who's been an un-formidable rock of protection, love, and understanding through this process.  If I were to put someone else in my shoes, I feel like I could easily understand her situation, her emotions, and reluctance to speak up, but it's a little bit more difficult when you're the one in those shoes.  The past few weeks -- so this is when I initially made my report in May, so during that time period and since it's been a roller coaster of emotions.  I constantly ask myself, did I have the power to stop him?  Did I have the power?  Could my voice have been the one that broke the chain of abuse and stopped him in his tracks?  Even now speaking the truth is, admittedly, difficult.  It's vulnerable.  It's risky.  People might still arrive at their own misguided conclusions, and I'm powerless to stop it.  However, I'm convinced it's the right thing to do.  Even though my case may be  out of a hundred similar cases, I want to stand with all women who came forward before me and after me if just to say you're not alone.  And speaking up for my loved ones, my nieces, my nephews, my family, brothers, sisters, friends, I pray they would never find themselves in similar circumstances, but should that day come, I want them to be courageous, truthful, and to speak up without shame.  I am speaking simply to stand for truth and to face fear and to refuse to give fear a foothold any longer.  Since I gave my initial statement to Doctor Munford -- Doctor Munford -- detective -- got you.DETECTIVE MUNFORD\",\n",
       " '  Thank you.MS. BEDFORD',\n",
       " \"  Getting all of this on paper and preparing for this has been no small feat.  The amount of energy and emotional toll required to process and digest all of it has been completely draining.  I agonized for hours whether or not to speak in person, processing the potential repercussions and how my actions and decisions to speak up would affect loved ones around me, the opinions people have of me.  I wish I could say this was it, that this crime would no longer affect me or myloved ones, that I could forgive once, find closure, and simply move on, I just want it to be over, but, unfortunately, it's not that easy.  The truth is that once the gavel comes down and the sentence is revealed, for me the battle is not over.  Memories remain and a sense of uneasiness and uncertainty has been created from the choice to come forward, to stand, and to be counted.  How does one gain victory over memories?  You can battle memories but you can't erase them.  We try to keep them at arm's length, stop, locked someplace outside the boundary of our daily lives.  However, despite all our effort to squelch, bury, and forget, those memories remain and they find a way to invade at the most inopportune times.  They have no scruples, no manners, or decorum.  All it takes is one trigger to unlock the door and those memories rush in like a flood.  Sometimes during even our most private and intimate moments they rush in unwelcomed with the ability to make us feel just as ashamed, just as embarrassed, small, and powerless as we felt when the incident first happened.  While I have hope to find peace and gain quicker victory over the emotions that accompany those memories, fighting to remain at a place of peace will be a battle I fight for the rest of my life.  Memories like that try to accuse you at every opportunity.  During this season of life, this is my reality.  By making a decision to speak I must not only face the memories of those events but unearth, revisit, and reassess all the details I so decidedly buried years ago.  There were things I didn't understand and things I made excuses for, because, quite frankly, I was afraid.  And processing it all has been both painful, damaging, liberating, and terrifying all at once.  For the longest time my story was hidden.  No one could hurt or judge because no one knew.  Now it feels -- well, not feels, everyone knows.  Try to imagine yourself stripped naked, exposed to the world standing in a room filled with people examining you, judging you.  I kept my secret away for years because of fear.  I imagined the worst thing that could happen and the risk felt too great.  I'm still convinced my decision to stand for truth, to silence shame, and to be counted is the right thing to do, but I didn't anticipate -- what I didn't anticipate was that this resolve to stand for truth would be challenged in my own mind every single time I chose to share my story.  Entrusting the truth  of  sheetsPage  to  of // \",\n",

       " \" AMto others, it's not without risk.  You hear it over and over.  It's a safe place.  Safe?  You want to believe that.  But no matter which way you slice it, you're still standing there naked in the middle of a room vulnerable revealing some painful details to people, people who have both the power to heal and hurt, restore and ostracize, support and reject, or bully and blame, and you're powerless to control their reactions.  Simply observe children out on a playground and you'll learn very quickly human beings do not need a reason to be unkind.  So if history dictates that a storm might be coming and that people could be both unkind towards you and towards the loved ones that stand up for you, you brace for impact, and this is the tumultuous aftermath.  It is paranoia and the fear of not being accepted.  It's dealing with the swirling, raging, chaotic storm of thoughts and fears that accompany one's choice to be vulnerable and being forced to face the uncertainty that comes from an unavoidable reality.  What was hidden is no longer hidden, and because of that, circumstances in your life could be different than they were before.  I didn't anticipate that I would second-guess myself, that I would second-guess my relationships, and even the thoughts of those closest to me.  I found -- it's not difficult to imagine what people are thinking.  Granted, saying, hey, I know what you must think before people have had a chance to express their opinion isn't exactly fair, but it's not difficult for my train of thought to go down that track.  As a result of what's happened with Doctor Nassar I need to fight harder to trust those close to me and equally hard to make insignificant the opinions of those that would come against the truth of who I am.  And that's a whole separate level, my own thoughts towards myself.  You're faced with the realization that you could have said something and didn't because you were afraid, ignorant athletes.  We're supposed to be brave.  We're supposed to be strong.  But you were a coward.  Your dad is a police officer, you should have known better.  You made the wrong choice.  You see, it's not that difficult for our own hearts to condemn us either.  I have battled guilt of not speaking up.  I questioned my ability to make sound decisions, and I needed to face the truth that, yes, I was scared.  But I was recently reminded by a friend of a passage I love in my bible.  It's  John, \",\n",
       " \" through , that says, Little children, let us not love in word and speech but in action and truth and by this we will know that we belong to the truth and will assure our hearts in his presence.  Even if our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts.  He knows all things.  So my conclusion, I'm still searching for healing, for wholeness.  I know it's there for me but at this point in time I can't see it fully, but I'm battling for it.  Every person who has come forward must find their own way to stand under the weight of it all.  As an athlete, I was trained to battle, to be a warrior, to fight and overcome, so for me in my mind I find myself engaged in an all-out war against any accusation that might come against the truth of who I know myself to be.  As a Christian I have every reason to hope, yet right now I'm fighting to believe that.  When my heart condemns on every side, when that train of thought starts barreling down the tracks a hundred miles an hour with no sign of stopping, what's left to me is to step out in front of that train, root, ground myself in the truth of who I am, and stand firm in that foundation and push back.  I am loveable.  I am wanted.  I am significant.  I am accepted.  I am valuable.  I was made to love God and love people without fear.  Depression is not my portion but joy and hope are my portion.  The road to healing looks steep from where I am standing now, but I am a warrior.  There are unformidable truths that God says about me that no man can steal or spoil, so I arm myself with these truths.  They're a sword in my arsenal and I know the end of the story for me.  I will win, but I'm still -- right now I'm still in the fight.

I took a step back and realized that, once again, I was letting the fear, the shame, and the guilt own me.  I decided it was time to stand up to Larry Nassar and to those that enabled him to continue down this ravaging path of sexual abuse.  Today I am here for me and to be an advocate for the women and young girls whose voices have been silenced for so many years.  I remember the first time Larry Nassar  of  sheetsPage  to  of // ',\n",

       " \" AMsexually assaulted me.  It is not something easily forgotten, the intense sense of terror, anxiety, and disbelief came washing over me.  I lay there in pain unable to speak, staring blankly at the wall, desperately searching for a way to escape.  I kept repeating in my head, this is a mistake, this isn't real.  I thought, he's a famous doctor, there's no way he would do something inappropriate in front of my mom.  Well, I was wrong.  He used his power and position in society to earn our trust so that he could use us for his own sexual pleasure and gratification.  These, quote, treatments happened over and over again, eating away at my innocence as a child.  I was just a young girl with big dreams.  Aspiring to be the best figure skater I could be.  This is what I received in return for my dedication to the sport.  A sport that I loved so much, tarnished with vile memories.  I'm not sure I could even ever look at figure skating the same again, which is a shame because the sport essentially defined who I was as a child.  I have always struggled with intimacy in relationships because of what Larry Nassar did to me.  I have vivid flashbacks of him assaulting me.  Sometimes I can't even tolerate another person touching me in an intimate situation without feeling physical pain and experiencing these visual flashbacks.  I'm in the room again, on that table, reliving these events to this day.  I feel disgusting.  I find it hard to trust not only those I have been in intimate relationships with, but also those in positions of power.  I wonder who might betray me next?  Because if he could pull this off, then who's to stop anyone else from hurting me, too.  I have poor self-esteem and I experience frequent episodes of anxiety and depression.  When I see someone that looks or sounds like him, my heart races, just like it does before I have one of my beloved panic attacks.  Sometimes I feel a sense of guilt because somehow I wonder if it was my fault that all of this happened?  Relationships with my family members have suffered especially since all of this has become public.  The nightmares about what he's done have haunted me night after night.  As I sat down to write a statement, I asked myself, how can I put this horrific experience into words?  There are no words for this.  Despite these unfortunate events, I wanted to be clear that I will continue to overcome this.  I will grow as a person.  I will succeed in my career, and my family will flourish because his facade has been broken.  I am in charge now.  It has been hard accepting what Larry Nassar did to me.  I'm angry and I'm sad, but I will not be silenced anymore.  I encourage the court to enforce a minimum sentence of  years up to the maximum allowable sentence in prison.  It is imperative to show our society that sexual abuse will not be tolerated, and that we value the importance of bringing proper justice to those who have suffered by the actions of others.  But we cannot stop here.  Those who have enabled Larry Nassar in his general and high lifestyle need to answer to us as well.  Michigan State University must take accountability for their absence in putting an end to this abuse scandal.  MSU recently stated that no one affiliated with their university, quote, believed that Nassar sexually abused anyone until the news articles in .  Well, there's a difference between not believing and something seeming unbelievable.  Either way, they had the knowledge of the abuse, and their duty was to report it and take action.  If this had been appropriately addressed, I wouldn't be here talking to you today.  Something has gone severely wrong at MSU.  They have ignored us and their lack of action shows us that they stand behind a serial sexual abuser.  I had higher expectations for my alma mater.  Until then, we will do our best to heal, but I'm afraid for the safety of future students and athletes if MSU does not take ownership in their part to this story.  I hope today shed some light into the darkness that I have lived through, and I hope to give hope to those who have been through the same.  I am strong, and together we are even stronger.

I was a patient of Doctor Nassar from  through August of .  Today I can say that I am finally ready to face you.  Rather than someone that I used to trust, I am looking at a monster that took advantage of me.  I have a question for you.  Why?  Why did you feel that you could do this to us, and not only get away with it, but you also felt that you were allowed to?  You were the adult.  You were the doctor.  You were also someone that many people told me could fix my medical problems.  Instead, you groomed us into believing that you cared about us, but really you were just fixing your sick thoughts and fantasies.  I remember even lying to you at times saying I wasn't in too much pain just because I didn't want you to do the procedure.  I didn't know why I was asking this or lying to you.  I just knew something wasn't right.  You were truly sick.  I am coming forward so you can no longer hurt anyone else and take things away that you took away from me.  Ever since I realized what you were actually doing to me, it has been hell.  I have put my family and friends through hell.  I've also lost jobs because of how much you have affected me and put me through.  I have to rethink everything.  I have no trust left for anyone because you took that away.  How do I ever trust meeting new people after learning that someone I trusted for years has betrayed me and also took advantage of me?  So why on earth would I ever trust anyone again?  I try every day to overcome this, but every day is still a struggle.  More importantly, though, it's what this has done to my family.  We have to work on our relationships every day because now I tend to be so distant and push them away.  I would have never done this before.  But now I have, unfortunately, became really good at it because I still don't want to face what you have done to me and how much it affects me daily, so therefore it's just easier to be by myself.  I truly hope with all of us coming forward and finally saying what we need to say to you makes you realize what you have done.  I hope you think about it every day just like I do.  I want this all to go away.  I want the nightmares of you coming into my room to go away.

I was a gymnast, competitive gymnast, and really dedicated to the sport.  I spent a lot of time in the gym, had a lot of injuries.  This one year -- this one month in ' we were at a competition and I ended up fracturing and dislocating my coccyx bone, my tailbone, and went over to see him the following day, and I had seen him before for, like, some wrist-type injuries, things like that.

I didn't know.  But I just remember being in so much pain, tears streaming down my face, holding on to the table just shaking, and I felt like I didn't -- I didn't know what to do.  My mother and him were having a conversation this whole time just about whatever, life, and it seemed like forever, went on forever, and finally he pulled his hand out anally and then inserted them vaginally, and that's when I knew there was a difference at that point and that he had his fingers in both places. // \",\n",

I went back to see him a couple weeks later, feeling better, and he says -- we didn't do an x-ray, didn't do any x-ray -- he said, it's out of place, again I need to redo the procedure, and I remember just being completely scared.  You know, I didn't want to go through that again.  I did not want to go through that.  But I went through it again, and the same thing, the tears coming down, almost kind of, just in the middle of it, I don't want to say blacked out but was, like, out of body almost, just numb, blank stare kind of, didn't know what to do.

Like, you know, all the other women were saying, you just believe that he's doing what's best for you, what's right for you.  Being that young, just trust, and he was very well respected and everybody talked so highly of him, so back in the gym I remember people whispering about what had happened because at that point it went around to everyone.

So, you know, this happened when I was .  I'm now .  And I have four kids of my own, and I've had so much depression over my life, over the years, I think that was my biggest struggle, severe depression.

I said, I just have to go up there and say what happened and speak my truth, so I'm trying to think if there's anything else that I need to pinpoint right now.  I just want other girls to be safe -- other people, not just girls, other athletes, even boys to be safe from sexual predators from this kind of abuse, and, oh, I do forgive you, too, Larry.  I believe in forgiveness.  I'm not going to carry that for the rest of my life.  I'm not.  I have important things to do as a mom.  I have some really great people in my life.

I am a mother of a beautiful two year old daughter.  I have been an attorney for over a decade.  I am someone's partner, someone's sister, someone's friend, someone's neighbor.  And I am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse of the man who sits before me today, Larry Nassar.  Larry, it has been many, many moons since our paths last crossed.  I stand here today as what I understand to be one of the earliest reported cases of sexual abuse at your hands.  I think it is important to what I want to say to you today to start from the beginning.  Something I never realized about you is that your relationship with the sport of gymnastics, and thus little girls in leotards, started in your high school years when you worked as an athletic trainer starting in  for which you somehow earned a varsity letter in women's gymnastics, thanks to your work with the team.  Seven years later in  your relationship with the sport of gymnastics and little girls in leotards would continue.  This time in the greater Lansing area at Great Lakes Gymnastics Club.  You were three years out of college.  I was eight years old.  As our volunteer athletic trainer at Great Lakes you practically lived in the gym.  You were there almost every single day for hours with your big black medical bag full of supplies over your shoulder.  You arrived to the gym early to tape our ankles and shin splints and stayed late to tend to the rips on our hands and our pulled muscles.  I general -- it genuinely seemed as if you had a tireless passion for your work, for the sport, and, in turn, for us.  You were not yet the famous Olympic doctor.  You were not a doctor at all.  You hadn't started medical school at Michigan State University.  You weren't married to Steph.  I hadn't been a guest at your wedding nor danced at your reception yet.  You were not a father to three children, two of them little girls.  So who were you back then?  You were a young man with his whole future ahead of him, a future that seemed to be full of nothing but promise and passion.  You were the man who was loved and trusted by dozens and dozens of us little girls and our families.  You quickly became a fixture at the gym, everyone's favorite.  You were the good cop to coach // \",\n",
       " '',\n",
       " \" AMPage  to  of  of  sheetsJohn Geddert's bad cop.  When he broke us mentally and physically, depriving us of water on a hot summer's day in the un-air conditioned gym or pushing us to practice on broken bones, you were the one who stepped in.  You defended us.  You stood up to him on our behaves.  You protected our bodies from further pain.  You literally and metaphorically put us back together.  It seemed as if we were a little family back then.  In hindsight, a readily dysfunctional one all in a sense growing up together.  You, John, Kathie Klages, and that first generation of gymnasts known as the originals.  We were all armed with nothing but dreams.  John dreamed of getting a girl to the Olympics at any cost.  You dreamed of becoming a sports medicine doctor.  And I with mediocre gymnastics ability dreamed of going away to college, getting married, having a family.  And I also dreamed of becoming a sports medicine doctor because that was your dream and I wanted to be just like you.  Those early years in the gym were brutal, as I know you must remember.  John was young and pushed all boundaries.  He was boss.  The enforcer.  The screamer.  The thrower.  The perfectionist.  The one from whom we desperately sought approval or even just some small sign that he actually cared for us and not just for winningYou, Larry, were the gentle one, the nurturer who always had a smile, a hug, a kind word.  You earned our trust.  You earned my trust.  But, more importantly, as I was just a little girl, you earned my mother's trust.  You treated us like family.  You attended each of my doctors' appointments.  You sat with my mother during my surgeries.  We were guests at your wedding.  And yet at some point you began pushing boundaries in your own terribly, terribly troubled way.  None of us will ever, ever, ever know when or where you started abusing children.  Was that always your plan when you found yourself attracted to the sport of gymnastics as early as high school?  Had you abused anyone before then?  Was the good guy persona just an act?  Were you building our trust for a reason?  So that you could perpetrate and penetrate later on?  And, most importantly, who was that first girl?  Am I her?  Do you even remember?  Do you even remember what we will never forget?  Can you even remember, Larry, when it all began?  Was there any traceable, albeit faint, voice of conscious within you back then saying, don't do it?  Do you remember how you justified it to yourself that first time?  I am sure I will never know the answers to my questions, but what I do know is that I laid alone naked in your apartment in , me,  years old, you  years old, while you massaged my tiny body, touching my clitoris and penetrating my formerly un-penetrated self.  By this time you were in medical school at the Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine.  You had called my home and asked me to come to your apartment where you once lived -- where you lived alone because you were conducting a study on flexibility on behalf of the medical college and you needed subjects for the study.  My mother was out of town but granted permission for me to go to your house because not only did she love and trust you, but because I was supposed to be one of several subjects participating in your Michigan State study.  I got a ride to your apartment from my neighbor, and, predictably, there were no other subjects there.  You instructed me to disrobe and take a bath in your tub in order to heat my muscles and relax which would aide in your measuring of my flexibility.  After my bath you rewarded me for my generous participation in your study by having me lay naked on the treatment table in the living room of your sparse one bedroom apartment as you massaged the entirety of my  year old body, suggesting that I relax as you slipped your adult fingers in and out and in and out of my body.  That was one of the many, many times that your hands were in me, on me over the next many years.  You became a doctor, started treating more patients, and we all know how the rest of this story unfolds.  Now here we sit, Larry, exactly  years since our paths first crossed.  Next year I will be  years old.  And you, you're spending the rest of your life in prison.  What you have to live with at this point as a purported Catholic man is not my problem and, quite frankly, I really do not care, but what I have to live with?  I may be the oldest victim survivor here this week.  Had I not been sucked into your pretend care and pretend love, had I not trusted you, had I actually understood that having my vagina and anus penetrated by a grown man that I loved and trusted when I was , , , and beyond was not okay and that was not your love or your care for me or your duty as my athletic trainer or Michigan State  of  sheetsPage  to  of // \",\n",

       " \" AMmedical school student or Michigan State doctor or Olympic doctor, then I could have spared every girl who came after me and the suffering that only someone who has experienced this will understand.  You chose to take from me, from all of us, something that was simply not yours to take; a shaken, if not irreparable, sense of self, a grave inability to trust, to open ourselves up to love, to sleep, to work, and some days to breathe.  What you took was sick and psychotic and disturbed and bottom line a robbery.  Had I been able to identify the wolf in sheep's clothing of a sexual predator under the guise of a loving friend and medical professional and eventual employee of the trusted Michigan State University, none of the other girls would be standing here before you this week having to face you, their robber.  So what you need to hear from me today is this.  When a grown man penetrates the vagina and/or the anus of a small girl or does anything at all to compromise her sense of trust or safety, the course of her life is changed forever.  In that moment when you had each and every girl who is here this week on your table, not to mention the hundreds and thousands, potentially, of girls who are not here or have not yet come forward, in that split second when you made the choice to put that finger inside of our little tiny bodies for the first time, not for medical treatment but for your own pleasure, you changed the entire course of our lives.  One moment, one finger, you took something from us that we will never, ever get back.  Our innocence.  Our childhoods.  And, in a sense, our virginities.  Those were not yours to take.  And yet in that moment when you took each of us -- from each of us for the first time, the course of your life did not change -- well, not immediately anyway.  You ate dinner.  You brushed your teeth.  And you went to sleep.  You were rewarded with prestigious roles.  You got to travel the world.  You were entrusted with the job of caring for the United State's most talented gymnasts.  You went to the Olympics, not once, many times, before John and then with John.  How each victim survivor has and will continue to navigate this life-altering catalytic experience that you chose for us will run the entire spectrum.  Some will never trust, never engage in functional relationships, sexual or otherwise, and some will never give birth because the very thought of having to see a physician who will have to touch them in personal places paralyzes them.  Some will suffer from anxiety and sleepless nights for the rest of their lives.  Some will never overcome the depression that results from having been a victim of your sexual abuse.  Others will become activists, warriors for this cause.  They will dedicate their lives to ensuring that people like you are not enabled and in a sense indirectly permitted to do as much damage as you were enabled to do by the likes of Michigan State University, USA Gymnastics, and Twistars.  And me, Larry?  I want you to know that while you spend the rest of your life behind bars, my life has been and will be okay.  I am a survivor of stage four disease.  I live with two autoimmune diseases, and I haven't slept soundly since .  I could spend another hour depicting how I personally, medically, and psychologically have suffered at your hands, but, quite frankly, I don't care to.  All you need to know about me, Larry, is that I'm free, I am successful, I am a mother, and I am happy.  Not because you were one of the most, if not the most, formative males in my entire life but in spite of you and in spite of that fact.  I am okay.  What I know for sure, Larry, is this, your legacy will not be that of a healer, of a great Olympic, Michigan State doctor, of a respectable man, of a good father, or husband, or son.  Unfortunately, your legacy is that you are quite possibly the greatest perpetrator of sexual abuse of all time.  That, my former friend and loved one, is yours to live with.  None of us in this room, Larry, is your final judge.  You may attempt to do good while you are in prison, removed from society for the rest of your life, and knowing you, you will and you will try, but what you've done, what you've taken, and how boldly and shamelessly you've taken it for decade after decade after decade, I can only wonder what might become of your soul.  I pray for Steph and your children because the Lord knows they need it now and they will always need it.  And I pray for the hundreds of women you abused who have not come forward, each for their own heavy reasons.  And as for you, Larry, the rest of your life you will be a prisoner, but what should we call you?  A predator?  A criminal?  A molester?  A psychopath?  A pornographer?  An abuser?

Your words will go in and out and in and out of his brain in his sleep, while he's awake and behind bars, so I appreciate the thoughtfulness, the detail, and the depth of your words.  They were very heartfelt and powerful, but also I know you say you've gotten past it, and I don't know if you'll ever really get past it, only you know the harm, and one of the things that you said troubles me in that being one of the earliest ones you wonder if you would have said something then, if it wouldn't be this case.  That's a heavy burden for a  year old, and at your age I know there's still a  year old girl inside of you who feels that way.  And I need you to let go of that.  I don't think there's any victim -- actually, I know there is no victim survivor who blames any other victim, including the first or the second or the third.  Because as you know as a lawyer, as a trained individual, so much goes unreported because of the pointing of blame, not belief of the treachery.  When you talk about it, people don't want to believe it.  It's not a popular subject.  There's no one that blames you, and you need to just let go of that, because you've done so well, and I think that's a bit of a stumbling block, and you are absolutely correct, your life is wonderful and it will continue to be so and you are just this -- because you're a little bit older -- no offense, you're beautiful, but you're a little bit older than the rest of the victims, so they can look at you and say, I can be like her, because some of them are not as strong as you yet, so it's so important that you talk about what you did, what you accomplished, that you've let go of this, and the only thing I ask you is to let go of that  year old girl, give her permission to say it's okay, I didn't report it, because you know at  you are powerless really.  You don't have a voice.  There were adults who should have been watching and checking.  It's not your fault there's other victims, so let go of that, and thank you for being such a strong role model with such an epic voice.

It wasn't the wrong crowd or going places that they weren't supposed to be or even using drugs or alcohol.  It was something we never thought we would have to even think about, it was this man, Larry Nassar.  He was someone we completely trusted.  He was our friend, our neighbor, Lindsey's friend, and her doctor.  Someone who was so well respected by everyone we never second-guessed his intentions on our daughter.  Larry had been Lindsey's doctor since she was nine years old.  He was also Lindsey's mentor, her confidant, her employer, and he was also someone who ultimately abused her on a daily basis for many, many years, starting around the age of .  These photos are how little she was when he began the abuse on her.  He convinced these little girls that this was a medical treatment necessary to help their injuries.  He also told and convinced the little girls not to discuss this treatment with their parents because they would not understand.  This treatment continued for many years.  These children thought that this was the norm.  He was doing it to multiple gymnasts so they all thought this was what Larry did to make them feel better.  These girls had no idea this wasn't a medical procedure.  He had always told -- we always told both our kids that if anyone touches you down in your private areas, except for a doctor, to come to us immediately.  She had no reason to be alarmed because he was her doctor, just as we told her.  He was also someone she completely trusted, her sound board after a long, hard practice.  Why would he ever want to harm her?  Our family was devastated to learn of Larry's actions.  We did not want to believe it, but it hit hard and fast.  The betrayal we feel is sometimes very hard to grasp.  Our daughter is scarred forever.  Our son is scarred forever, and we as parents are scarred forever.  Lindsey's dad, her brother, and I will never be the same.  We trust no one.  We have many sleepless nights over the guilt we feel for missing this.  We never imagined that we would be those parents we all see on the news whose children were abused by someone, someone close to their family, and the parents had no idea.  This is us.  This is our true reality.  The guilt we feel will never go away.  All the questions we think of and all the red flags we missed, it truly has been gut wrenching and will be embedded in our minds forever.  With his lack of true remorse, this is a person who will repeat his crimes.  You can hear it in his statements to you and other judges that he still does not accept the damage he has done to all these kids, parents, his own family, and all that was associated with him.  Your Honor, we ask that you give this monster the longest sentence available so he never harms again.

I had worked so hard to get there and I, along with my family, had sacrificed so much to get to that point.  My spine was badly fractured and my life, but more important to me, my gymnastics career was falling apart.  He was the only one I was wildly assured who could really help me, help me further than any other doctor had helped me so far.  He was just so talented and brilliant, they said.  Indeed, he did seem impressive.  He was absurdly nice and did everything he could to make me feel comfortable the second I met him.  He smiled widely each time he saw me and on the surface it felt like he genuinely cared for me.  It seemed like he was determined to help me get better and that gave me another level of certainty.  Most of all, he gave me hope.  I thought he was the most trustworthy doctor I ever could have imagined.  In my innocence I felt that I would have done anything -- anything to heal my fractured back and not quit the sport I loved and persisted through since I was two years old.  Gymnasts are tough as nails.  They will fight.  They will bleed.  And they will persist all for their dreams.  And that's exactly how I was.  I still remember Nassar calmly and vaguely assuring me that his treatment regiment might be a little uncomfortable but that it would surely help to heal my pain and return me to the sport I loved.  These were just the magic words I was looking for that none of the many other doctors I had previously seen would tell me.  Here I was a scared little girl in excruciating back pain, willing, begging even to suffer through for my sport.  This grown man confidently offered me salvation, healing, and freedom, and I trusted him, but he turned out to be a monster.  I am disgusted -- disgusted that Larry Nassar, the trusted adult, authority figure, and famous doctor had the audacity to use his incredible power, prestige, and influence to sexually abuse me, a little girl, right there in his office in the safest and warmest of places with such an overlying sense of healing and recovery.  I was counting on him.  He broke in loudly without consent or restraint.  He was an unwarranted intruder to my most private, intimate, never before touched places without warning, without gloves, and without explanation.  And so again and again and again he abused me all the while telling me wild tales of his Olympic journey and his family, very confidently, suavely even, trying to distract me from the un-distractable.  It certainly seemed and, unfortunately, viscerally and physically felt like he had done this treatment many times before.  This was yet another reason I desperately told myself to trust him.

To this day that pain and these feelings are still there.  Each appointment with him I desperately waited for it to be over, to be healed, putting every last drop of faith in him.  I remember being embarrassed each time I rose off the table because it was so obviously drenched with sweat.  Then one day after his prolonged and consistent abuse he finally gave me my fate.

       " \" AMaway depressed, dejected, molested, and confused, now alone to part ways with my deepest love, gymnastics.  My innocence was ruthlessly taken away from me never to return.  This was such a dark period in my life that still today is difficult for me to revisit.  As I stand here I still flashback to the feelings of fear laying frozen in his office, my sweating, shaking body, adrenalin pumping, painfully clutching the sides of the table waiting for this sick treatment to be over.  My little child self, smarter and more astute than I gave her credit for, knew something was wrong but she was petrified to the point of physical and emotional paralysis as she tried so hard to keep trusting this man she thought was her savior, vigilantly ignoring how she felt and what was really going on.  I was so afraid to talk to anyone.  The most confusing part was that my mother was in the room with us while this happened.  He strategically placed himself between us and skillfully obscured what was happening.  I felt a disoriented sense of safety since my mom was there, and, after all, he told me it was going to be uncomfortable.  What I didn't realize, she couldn't see exactly what was happening.  This sickens and continues to baffle me to this day.  Larry made me believe that this was my only hope.  That he was my only hope.  Besides, all the other adults around me told me so, and I so shut my eyes so tight that they hurt and I held my breath.  I summoned that notorious gymnastic strength and I marched forward.  For years I had this atrocious secret and fear.  I felt so much shame and embarrassment.  I suffered but I told myself to be tough.  When the reports about him started trickling out I just knew I was right all this time and I wasn't alone.  Then my world swiftly stopped.  Everything I had pushed away for so long came over me like a waterfall.  All my denial, repression, and depression that had been present and underlying there all along overcame me.  My trauma reopened anew; a fresh deep wound.  While the constant news following Nassar this past year has been vindicating at some points, it has mostly been cruel and exhausting.  I relive my pain each and every day questioning why he did this to us and never finding the right answer.  I completely dropped out of my life this past year as the gravity and wickedness of Nassar's serial abuse has overcome me.  Months at a time I did not leave my bed, sometimes questioning why I was even alive, all while his touch continued to violently linger on my body as it does today.  I lost my wits.  I screamed.  I woke up crying.  I went to bed crying.  I did not, I still do not understand.  These uncomfortable, invasive memories are my reality now.  The imprint of his face and abuse hinder my life which at times has turned into a nightmare.  Crippling complexes such as paranoia, anxiety, depression, sexual issues, and insomnia, to name a few, have all taken their unique and oppressive turn at overshadowing my life as a direct result of what Larry Nassar did to me.  Then and now his abuse has cost me.  It is important to everyone hearing this that to this day I still do not feel safe.  The world feels unsafe.  Men feel unsafe.  I can't sleep without a night light.  I'm paranoid when I walk anywhere alone, looking around every corner constantly believing I'm about to be attacked.  If someone enters a room without announcing themselves I jump and border on the edge of a nervous breakdown.  I'm intensely vigilant that someone, somewhere, whichever place I might be is about to take advantage of, sexualize, or hurt me.  There are oftentimes I shield myself from the world and pray that men don't find me appealing lest they target me, manipulate me, and hurt me like Nassar so smoothly did.  I feel disconnected from the world, alone, and in pain.  I couldn't trust anyone to keep me safe back then and I can't trust anyone to keep me safe today.  I have lost my ability to be confident with myself and others.  To those at MSU, USAG, and the USOC who knew about Larry Nassar and did not act, the sin of omission is just as bad as the sin itself.  As if dealing with the intense publicity and pain around Nassar wasn't enough, you have added a heartless, depraved level of denial and victim shaming to the mix.  You have said terrible things.  For example, that victims didn't understand the nuanced difference between sexual abuse and medical treatment and it is virtually impossible to stop a determined sexual predator on your campus.  This is disgusting.  Do you know how the statements make us feel?  Do you understand the impacts of our words?  Do you know how these statements put other victims in the state of fear so deep that they may never come forward?  // \",\n",

This means that every day we still have to remind ourselves it's okay that we came forward.  What happened to us is very, very real, even though we so desperately tried to deny it for so long.  I recently learned that Nassar's crimes could have been prevented as early as  when the first brave woman came forward.  Learning our abuse could have been prevented but instead flourished for decades is a bitter and nauseating pill to swallow.  Adults were enamored by Nassar because they experienced all of the trustworthy, impressive, illustrious talented elements of him, minus the abuse.  They wanted to protect him, and now that the act is up, they are emotionless and indifferent, lackadaisically managing the issues they once overlooked and placing their limited information on evading responsibility as opposed to taking ownership.

Also, if I do tell them, what if someone overhears?  Will people look at me differently?  Will people judge me or will they pity me because they feel bad?  Larry Nassar manipulated me psychologically.  He made me deny how I felt when I was screaming inside to stop what was happening because he acted so calm like nothing ever happened.  He made me trust him and not second-guess his medical procedure.  There are things in my past that I am not proud of.

I was  when I went to see Mr. Nassar for help with my back pain.  At the time my father was terminally ill with cancer so my parents were unable to attend this appointment.  Mr. Nassar took advantage of my circumstances and of me.  I remember him telling me that he could give me a massage to help with my back pain.  I cautiously undressed and laid down with a sheet over me as he instructed.  He proceeded to penetrate me vaginally and massage my breasts.  My body froze.  I was screaming inside but lay there too scared and confused to do anything.  After he completed his, quote, treatment, he told me to get dressed while he sat there watching.  He then scheduled weekly visits for me.  In a daze I left the office only to be stopped by the receptionist to schedule my next appointment.  I informed her he had already done so to which she looked confused and responded, quote, he doesn't schedule his own appointments.  After reviewing my chart she was hesitant but verified that he had scheduled these.  Looking back I realize that he had scheduled these to continue the abuse.  He had found a young girl in a vulnerable situation and intended to take full advantage of that situation.  When I got home from school that day I told my mom what had happened.  She took me to the police station where I filed a report and went to the hospital to get a sexual assault kit done.  I was terrified of what this exam entailed.  I sat in a cold hospital room, my body tensed when they took the samples.  I remember fearing that no one would believe me.  Unfortunately, this fear became a reality.  About a week later the police contacted my family and asked us to come in for a meeting with Mr. Nassar.  I told my parents that I did not want to face him so they went without me.  At this meeting Mr. Nassar informed my parents that this was simply a misunderstanding and that because I was not a gymnast, I was not as comfortable with my body.   of  sheetsPage  to  of // \",\n",

       " \" AMThere was no investigation and I was left to feel like the whole situation was my fault.  I felt powerless and like there was no one I could trust.  I struggled with these feelings as I watched my dad dying right in front of me.  My anxiety was at an all time high.  I suffered so severely that at times I was unable to leave my home.  I began medication and therapy.  To this day I still suffer from anxiety and continue with these treatments  years later.  I went on with my life and successfully pursued my career as a physician assistant.  However, the memory of what happened never left me.  For  years I wondered if I was the only one or if there were others he had done this to.  I tried to convince myself that I was the only one and that I had scared him enough by filing a police report so that he would never do this again.  Sadly, this was not the case.  I remember the day I found out about the other allegations.  I broke down and a huge wave of guilt came over me.  I felt like I should have done more to stand up for myself and to prevent the abuse of the other women.  As the number of victims grew and the stories came out, I was horrified.  Mr. Nassar took away the innocence of so many young women and girls.  He blamed us for, quote, misunderstanding what had happened.  I will never forget what Mr. Nassar did to me but I do have a sense of relief knowing that no other young woman or child will be subjected to his abuse.  I recently gave birth to my first child and therefore was unable to travel to Michigan for sentencing.  This is a joyous time in my life but the trauma from the past and the realization of the extent of his abuse has put a cloud over it.  I will move on and continue to be a loving wife and mother.  I will continue my work as a PA and provide compassionate care to other victims of sexual abuse.  I hope that some day he will realize the affects he has had on his victims and their families.  I am hopeful that today will provide justice and assistance in the healing process for all of Mr. Nassar's victims.  Sincerely, Brianne Randall.  THE COURT\",\n",
       " \"  Thank you for reading that.  I don't know if Brianne is listening or not but there will be a record, and what I want to say to her is that today with her words there is no misunderstanding of what happened.  I am very clear that no victim has lied, that they were all assaulted, that the use of treatment was misused, mis-defined, and I suspect that there were appointments that were not needed, probably in violation of other statutes, insurance paid for this, so the crimes just get bigger and bigger, and I'm saddened that Meridian Township Police Department, who I know to be very efficient, very good, and we hear testimony all the time from them, I see the good work they do, I'm sorry they missed this one.  But, again, defendant became a good liar, and what happened, what I'm gathering from all these victims, is that because Meridian Township, because universities, because parents, all unsuspecting, seemingly, defended him, he felt untouchable so he continued to touch children for his own pleasure.  I have heard what Ms. Randall has said and I applaud her words, and I can't imagine not being believed while her father is dying, so she's grieving the loss of her childhood and the loss of a parent.  That is immeasurable pain, so I thank her for her words.  Next.  MS. POVILAITIS\",\n",
       " \"  Judge, the next survivor has also written a statement that we will be reading on her behalf.  We have reviewed that statement.

       " '  In September  I received a Daily News e-mail from my local patch.com.  The top headline read, Former USA Gymnastics doctor accused of abuse.  I will never forget that moment.  I was stopped at a red light near my home.  There was a picture of him along with the headline.  I had to pull my car over.  I dry heaved in the street while sobbing uncontrollably.  I was disgusted by myself and my body.  I felt dirty and helpless, so very lost and so very sad. I called the Michigan State Police Department that day, and after five years of silence I reported his abuse.  I had to relive all his treatments and every question, every detail, remembering how he touched me and penetrated me without gloves or lubricant.  I cried for weeks and then months.  // ',\n",

       " \" AMPage  to  of  of  sheetsIt has affected my role as a mother, as a daughter, and as a wife.  But the last year I've had to put a brave face on in front of my young children to protect them from their sad, confused, and grieving mother.  I have had to forgive my parents for not being more involved in my treatments as an injured and defeated young college athlete.  I have had to explain to my loving husband why intimacy had become difficult for me.  I will be affected by Doctor Nassar's abuse for the rest of my life.  At the time of the treatment I hated his demeanor.  His use of too much medical jargon, his groping and his touching of my vaginal area inside and out.  I dreaded every appointment.  I was suffering from a herniated disc, L- and S-, and had chronic nerve pain shooting down my legs.  I had already had one surgery and was trying to avoid a second more serious spinal fusion surgery because I knew the impact it would have on my collegiate athletic career and my life.  I was  years old.  All I wanted to do was to be able to compete in my sport again and live a pain-free, active lifestyle.  My athletic trainer trusted that Doctor Nassar would live up to his reputation.  Doctor Nassar was recommended to me as the second opinion outside the medical team at the University of Michigan.  His reputation, his authority, his accolades cloud the truth behind the procedures that was supposed to alleviate the nerve pain and to help me avoid surgery.  They didn't.  I had to have that spinal fusion surgery, but not before I endured several sessions of pure torture and agony.  Each treatment was an hour.  He massaged my breasts, buttocks, groin, hips, and would end with what felt like endless digital penetration.  Doctor Nassar never stopped his hands.  His treatments made mefeel like I was an animal, a piece of meat.  I remember using a rough paper towel in his office after treatment to wipe him off of me before leaving the exam room.  I remember being sore inside.  As a student athlete on scholarship at a Division One, Big Ten university with strength coaches, head coaches, assistant coaches, trainers, sports doctors, and physical therapists, the list goes on and on, our bodies were our most prized possession.  We trained them, worked them, and dealt with high levels of pain running through them.  Mind over matter.  Athletics were not something I did, an athlete was who I was.  Keeping my body healthy to maintain my spot on the field and maintain my financial scholarship was the most important thing in my life.  I was  years old but still a child living within the bubble division one Big Ten college sports.  I had to trust my coaches, trainers, and physical therapists.  I had to trust my doctors.  No questions asked.  Doctor Nassar knew this.  Doctor Nassar preyed on my desperation and my weakness.It is my opinion that Doctor Nassar should be held accountable for his strategic and manipulative abuse.  His sentence should keep him in prison for the rest of his life just as I was a victim of his abuse for the rest of mine.  Thank you, victim two. THE COURT\",\n",
       " \"  Thank you.  As to victim two, I'm hopeful she does not feel manipulated and a victim anymore, although we use that term simultaneously with a survivor.  She is a survivor.  I'm hoping now that her words are out, that she's publicly made this statement, that the crying will stop and be replaced with happiness and joy, because she is no longer defeated.  Defendant is defeated.  She a pillar of strength for coming forward, for recognizing what happened to her, and for joining in with the other victim survivors.  Together you are all such a strong voice, and I'm hearing this over and over, and maybe I'm repeating myself, I don't care, the more we have to hear it, as many times and as often as we can say it because victims -- other victims who need to come forward, and victim two needs to stop crying -- I'm hoping she stops crying.

Her question really resonates with me.  I will decide at sentencing how long.  The plea agreement, which, as I said, I will honor, but on the tail end I'll make that determination.  How much is a young girl's life worth?  Our constitution does not allow for cruel and unusual punishment.  If it did, I have to say I might allow what he did to all of these beautiful souls, these young women in their childhood, I would allow someone or many people to do to him what he did to others.  Our country does not have an eye for an eye and Michigan doesn't have the death penalty so I don't know how to answer how much is a young girl's life worth, but I have children of my own and there's not enough gold in the planet that would satisfy that question, and I think all of you victims are gold.

      "  Good morning.  My name is Kyle Stephens.  Up until this point I have been known as victim ZA or family friend.  I was the first to testify in this case, and weary of the attention that can come with that, I asked for anonymity.  This process has been horrific, but surprisingly therapeutic.  I am addressing you publicly today as a final step and statement to myself that I have nothing to be ashamed of. I met Larry Nassar when I was somewhere around the age of five years old.  My parents had become close friends with Larry and his wife, Stephanie.  They were all medical professionals and shared a passion for the subject.  Most Sundays Stephanie and my mother would cook dinner together for both families.  We shared sporting events, holidays, and many weekends in between.  It was during this time, I estimate I was approximately six years old, that Larry Nassar began to sexually abuse me.  He first exposed his penis to me in a dark boiler room in the basement of his home.  He told me, if you ever want to see it, all you have to do is ask.  He used his power as an adult to manipulate me.  Over a six year period he progressed from exposure to masturbating in front of me while playing hide and go seek, rubbing his bare penis on my bare feet, and penetrating my vagina with his fingers, all of which took place with my parents, my sibling, his wife, and his children in the same house.  Let me remind you of the interests of a six year old girl.  My favorite t.v. show was Clifford, the big red dog, and my favorite book was Junnie B. Jones.  I could not do a multiplication problem and still had not lost all my baby teeth.  I think we can all agree that someone of this maturity level should not be sexually active.  But I was.  Without my knowledge or consent I had engaged in my first sexual experience by kindergarten and joined an overwhelming statistic of sexual abuse victims.  It took the media coverage of the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic church and a friend confiding the details of her sexual abuse for me to realize that something was wrong.  I was  years old when I told my parents, when Larry rubbed my feet, he used his penis.  My parents confronted him and he denied any such action.  Due to complex details that I won't get into here, my parents chose to believe Larry Nassar over me.  I spent the years between  and  avoiding and detaching from my family.  To my father, someone who makes such heinous false accusations is the worst type of person.  His belief that I had lied seeped into the foundation of our relationship.  Every time we got into a fight he would tell me, you need to apologize to Larry.  I learned to ask for very little as I wanted my parents to know that I didn't need them, just as I felt they didn't want me.  It wasn't until I was about to leave for college when my father again pulled a need to apologize card and then I took another chance of clearing my name.  I told him that I wasn't lying and that Larry Nassar had indeed sexually abused me.  Larry Nassar's actions had already caused me significant anguish, but I hurt worse as I watched my father realize what he had put me through.  My father and I did our best to patch up our tattered relationship before he committed suicide in .  Admittedly, my father was experiencing debilitating health issues, but had he not had to bear the shame and self-loathing that stemmed from // \n",

      " AMPage  to  of  of  sheetshis defense of Larry Nassar, I believe he would have had a fighting chance for his life.  Larry Nassar wedged himself between myself and my family and used his leverage as my parents' trusted friend to pry us apart until we fractured.  And fractured we did.  My relationship with my mother is still marbled with pain, anger, and resentment, and for a long time I told people that I did not have a family.  I think it is important to note my relationship with the Nassar family after I accused him at age .  A year or two passed from the time that I made the accusation and our families began to spend time together again.  I was around  years old when Stephanie began pressuring me to babysit the Nassars' three children.  I responded with dismissive answers for a lengthy period of time before relenting.  It was at this point that I began to feel brainwashed.  At home I was a liar and when I was at the Nassars, either with my family or babysitting, it was as if I never accused him.  I felt I was losing my grip on reality.  I started to question whether the abuse ever really happened.  For my own sanity, I forced myself to walk through the abuse step by step so I didn't forget that I was not a liar.  It is to this that I credit my ability to recall the abuse so well throughout this process.  As I continued to babysit for the Nassars I started to become resolved to my purpose there.  With two young girls in the home I felt protective and that somehow my presence there would make a difference.  For seven years and several years into counseling -- for seven years and several years into counseling I cared for those children with all my heart.  My detachment from my family forced me to search for grants, participate in post-traumatic studies, ask for sliding scales, and babysit for the Nassars to pay for my own counseling.  When I look back now, I realize that my spirit was broken, lost, and confused, but then all I could think is that I needed to be there for those children in whatever way I could.  It was not until I was  that I cut all ties with the Nassar family.  The complex feelings of shame, disgust, and self hatred brought me bouts of depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and other compulsive conditions.  Sometimes I think it's hard for people to translate these generic terms into reality.  For me, it was a girl crying on the floor for hours trying not to rip out too much of her hair.  For me, it was a girl wanting the pain to stop so badly that she woke up for months to the thought, I want to die.  For me, it was a girl getting out her gun and laying it on the bed just to remind herself that she has control over her own life.  For me, it was a girl that spent so much time trying to fix herself that she forgot what she actually enjoys doing.  Sexual abuse is so much more than disturbing physical acts.  It changes the trajectory of a victim's life, and that is something that no one has the right to do.  Your Honor, with your permission, I would now like to address the defendant.  THE COURT\n",

You convinced my parents that I was a liar, that you didn't keep lotion strategically placed in the basement so you could beat your penis in my face while I hid.  But I still get sick at the smell of that lotion.  You convinced my parents that you didn't pull my feet into your lap, unzip your pants, and rub your erect penis against my bare skin, but I still flinch when my feet are near someone's lap.  You convinced my parents that you didn't stick your fingers in my adolescent vagina, but I knew when it was time to use my first tampon not to worry because my hymen wasn't intact.  You used my body for six years for your own sexual gratification.  That is unforgiveable.  I have been coming for you for a long time.

I can also tell you Larry Nassar is a predator without boundaries.  His patients weren't safe, his friends' children weren't safe, and even his own children weren't safe.

      "  Thank you.  Honorable Judge Aquilina, thank you for giving me this opportunity to tell you how Larry Nassar has hurt me and the effect that this has had on my life. I am Jessica Thomashow, also known as victim A.  I was sexually assaulted by Larry Nassar when I was nine and  years old.  Today I am  and a senior in high school, and this is my story.  My childhood was filled with happiness and love.  One of my loves was for gymnastics and for all my teammates in the gym.  Gymnastics was a big part of my childhood, and I spent many hours in the gym and at competitions, though, as you know, with gymnastics it is a very physically demanding sport and often comes with painful injuries.  I remember one of my first injuries, a rib misplacement.  This was the first time I heard of Larry Nassar and his reputation.  I remember telling my mom that my coaches told me I should see Larry Nassar for my injury, and to my surprise, she knew who he was.  She had trained under him when she went to medical school at Michigan State University.  One night my coaches arranged for me to see Nassar after practice to help with my rib injury.  Monday nights were when Larry Nassar came to Twistars to treat injured team gymnasts.  I remember my coaches telling me to go see him, and I was actually quite excited.  Then I went into the back room, and that's when everything changed.  I was alone in the back room with him.  He had me lie down on the table and he sexually assaulted me.  He touched the most innocent places on my body that day.  I remember fear and pain and asking myself, what is happening?  When it was over, I was so confused.  What had he just done to me, and why?  It was awful and embarrassing.  I left and kept the disgusting thing that had just happened to me to myself.  Two years passed.  I saw him several times again at his clinic at MSU, always with my mom, and they were normal appointments.  Then in  it happened again, right around my th birthday.  I had a stress fracture in my ankle and my dad took me to that appointment.  Before Nassar assaulted me, we had a great, meaningful conversation about my future.  He asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, and I said, I want to be just like you, a sports medicine doctor.  He gave me a gift, a pin from the Olympics, and told me, when you take my place as the new sports  of  sheetsPage  to  of // \n",

      "break\n",
      " AMmedicine doctor for gymnastics, then you can give me back this pin.  Nassar then told my dad he had to massage my ankle and it would be okay for him to wait in the waiting room.  After he left, Nassar told the medical student to leave the room, too.  After the room was cleared, he did it yet again.  He slid his ungloved hand up my leg and back into the most innocent part of my body, and I felt searing pain.  For  minutes he inserted his fingers into me and grunted while I lay there terrified.  Again I was confused by what had just happened.  He was a trusted doctor and what he did to me didn't make sense in my child's mind.  I didn't tell a sole, and I try not to think about it anymore, but my dream of becoming a sports medicine doctor ended that day along with my happy and trusting self.  He had broken me.  I lived the next several years in limbo.  Being sexually assaulted has changed me into an anxious teen, but I did not know that I had been abused and that was the source of my anxiety.  I no longer felt safe, and I had problems with trust.  My parents took me to a psychiatrist and a therapist when I was in ninth grade and this happened.  I was diagnosed with and treated for social anxiety disorder and saw a therapist on a weekly basis but did not have insight into the cause.  In the seventh and eighth grade I felt extremely uncomfortable around my male teachers.  I avoided them.  I hated talking to them, and I would feel panic if I was ever alone with them in a room.  Back then I didn't understand why I felt this way because all my peers loved our teachers, but being assaulted affected my relationship with my teachers and my anxiety was so intense that it made it hard to focus and learn at school.  I also developed an intense fear of male hands, like a PTSD response.  Now I get flashbacks when I see male hands and it makes me feel scared and threatened.  This fear changed the way I grew up and how I related to boys.  I did not want to hold hands or ever be close to my guy friends.  I couldn't be just a normal girl anymore, and I have forever lost a big piece of my childhood due to his abuse.  When the first IndyStar article came out my life changed.  I put the pieces together and realized I was molested by Larry Nassar.  I thought back to my appointments with him and could still feel what my nine and  year old self felt then; alone, scared, and in pain.  I wanted to puke.  I could feel his hands touching me, and that was the first time I had my first flashback, and to this day I still have them.  The flashbacks are paralyzing.  I had one just two weeks ago at school and could barely get out of my seat.  Thankfully I was able to stop my brain and went to the office.  I cried for an hour shaking with fear.  I would like to say something to my abuser, Larry Nassar.  You took advantage of my innocence and trust.  You were my doctor and I trusted you and you took complete advantage of that.  Why?  I used to ask myself that question all the time, especially while I was laying in bed crying myself to sleep.  What you did to me was so twisted.  You manipulated me and my entire family.  How dare you.  You had no right to do that, and because of your decision to molest me, you have caused so much pain in my life, and for the rest of my life I'm going to have to heal from what you did.  Your Honor, I understand the plea guidelines are for a minimum sentence range of  to  years, and I ask you to give Larry Nassar a  year minimum to  year maximum sentence for what he did to me.  I also ask on behalf of what he did to over a hundred other girls, we are all suffering having flashbacks, unable to have normal relationships, crying at night, feeling broken, and our lives have been forever changed.  He is a predator, and he won't be stopped unless he is behind bars for the rest of his life.  Thank you.  THE COURT\n",

I am a sheltered Christian, home-schooled girl who is still in competitive gymnastics.  From a young age I was raised to respect those in authority.  I was also taught that there are certain people who are there to help you; doctors, teachers, pastors, police officers, so going to see Nassar at the age of  it was -- that was my belief system, that he was there to help me.  I can remember the first time he assaulted me like it was yesterday.  I cried all the way home because of what he did to me.  He made me feel so yucky that I could not imagine this is what I had to endure to get better.  But I was .  I had never heard of a doctor purposely hurting someone.   when this began happening and  when I realized what happened; , a sophomore, and now a junior in high school.  What many people referred to as the best years of their life might have been the worst years of my life.  I can hardly explain what this past year and a half was like.  It was meetings and court appearances with attorneys, prosecutors, investigators, counselors.  It felt like endless meetings going back over a story that was so personal  of  sheetsPage  to  of // \n",

      "\n",
      "break\n",
      " AMto talk about.  What  year old girl wants to discuss their private parts with grown men, or anyone for that matter?  It was embarrassing.  It was emotional, and I dreaded every meeting and court appearance I ever had to endure because it meant I was going to speak the assault out loud for everyone in the room.  Every time it forced me to relive the horrible experience again.  That was overwhelming.  It caused sleepless nights, lots of stress because I was trying to balance school, competitive gymnastics, which is a lot of time and travel, and then this awful situation, all while trying to have somewhat of a normal teenage life.  I did not want anyone to know.  I did not come out to my teammates and friends until right before I had to go to court in May.  Even right now I wrestled with lying to reveal my identity so that I no longer feel like I am hiding.  Plus, it would be nice to be able to say I'm a survivor.  But at the same time I am unsure.  I do not want anyone to look at my differently, especially when I walk out on the gymnastics floor.  I want to be known for who I am and my gymnastics, not for being a victim of Larry Nassar.  This situation has also affected my family.  Being only  when I realized I was sexually assaulted my parents have been heavily involved.  This has been extremely hard on my mom with lots of feeling of guilt for being in the room, for trusting, and for not asking enough questions.  She cries a lot, but she was determined to fight for justice for me and all the victims.  My dad, it's just hard hearing the story over and over again.  Knowing what this monster did to his little girl makes him sick.  In front of me he tries to remain strong.  My siblings have paid a price because it has often consumed our time and our days.  Part of our devastation is just knowing the time frame in which I was assaulted, starting in July , knowing it could have been easily avoided.  If anyone -- if one or any of the stipulations had been enforced by anyone overseeing Nassar, this would have never happened.  To my knowledge, I am the first known victim after he was allowed to go back to work in July .  That fact is almost inconceivable to us, that he was so brazen to do the sexual assault in front of my mom, but also knowing he was still under investigation.  It actually speaks volumes to what he knew he could get away with because no one was truly watching.  He had mastered his performance, his act, his actions, his every move.  To Larry Nassar, here are some of my thoughts.  You had it all, prestigious doctor, family, career, loved, worshipped by the gymnastics community, smart, honors, the list could go on and on, and you allowed evil to take over every part of you and committed some of the worst acts imaginable, on children.  The innocent, the trusting.  I cannot even comprehend this at  years old.  I may not ever be able to comprehend what you did and what you threw away, all for your evil desires.  Your apology/words at the hearing in November was not an apology.  If the judge gives you an opportunity to speak again before sentencing, you need to try again.  You need to sincerely apologize, not for the crazy words you spoke before about why you took the guilty plea, for the community to heal, that you never intended for this forest fire to get out of control.  Even at  years old I know those are silly statements.  It was not an apology to any victim or their family, but the victims need to hear you say I am sorry, please forgive me.  I made terrible decisions that were based on my own desires with no regards of how I was hurting you that day and forever.  I manipulated so many people, all part of my scheme to be able to do what I ultimately wanted to do, and now I am begging, if you ever can, to forgive me for my disgusting actions.  Those are the types of sentences you need to say.  Now I want you to know I stand today not as your judge, eventually that is God's job.  I stand today knowing that God's forgiveness extends to the worst offenses.  I stand today praying that God extends the same grace to you and that you reach out and take it, but you do need to ask him for it.  I also stand today extending my forgiveness to you, not because you deserve it, but because our family will allow this tragic event to frame -- will not allow this tragic event to frame our lives, so we release this poison by extending forgiveness.  Your Honor, what I want you to know -- what I want you to know most is I am only .  My whole life is ahead of me.  Most people as they grow up get to write their own story.  They make choices that affect the next days of their lives.  They make good choices and bad choices, but with each decision they are paving the way for their own stories.  They write it, their story.  // \n",

Without consent, without gloves, without prior explanation he wrote on my story, and it will always be a part of me.  What my future holds is unknown.  How it will affect my relationships, schooling, decisions, trusts of others, especially doctors and men all is unknown.  I do not want this to defeat me, define me, outshine me, or confine me.  But it will always be a part of my story.  I still have a lot ahead.  What  year old or anyone has to or wants to go through all of this?  Just writing this statement has been stressful and emotional.  There are not enough words to convey my actual feelings.  Plus there seems to be endless things I could or want -- plus there seems to be endless things I could or want to say.  The list could go on forever.  Even as I work on my statement with my mom, we cry.  As this settles I will turn the page and begin a new chapter, one that I will write myself.  I pray and trust the Lord will be all I need to sustain me from this affecting my story.  Larry Nassar wrote his own story.  He made decisions, awful disgusting decisions, and those decisions should affect the rest of his life.  We do not want him to ever have a chance to write on anyone's story.  You now have the unique opportunity, one that you have earned, to be able to write on his story.  My family and I have prayed for you.  We have prayed that your sentence is the maximum number of years but within the parameters of what the Attorney General and prosecutor have established.  As you write on his story, please remember that you are writing on behalf of all the victims whose stories Larry Nassar wrote on.

She was delivered in a hospital using forceps and she required several surgeries, but for a whole year I sat up with this baby at night because she couldn't lay down, and the bond that came from her and I was just inseparable.  We did everything together as she continued to grow up.  Her childhood was a normal childhood and she wouldn't leave my side, and I needed to get her to be social with other kids so I enrolled her in Montessori, and for a whole week she screamed like a pig being cut because she thought I was leaving her, and finally on the fifth day she said, mommy, I know you'll be back.  I said, yes, I will.  I'm sorry.  During her normal childhood she, you know, wanted to do all the activities that all her little friends did, and we had these Saturday morning classes and the gymboree and the whatever, swim lessons, and so she really caught on to gymnastics, and she was enrolled at Artistic Gymnastics Academy in Roseville, Michigan, and her Saturday morning hour classes turned into several times a week, and then the coaches asked her if she would like to join team and I said, well, it's going to be her decision but she needed to understand the requirements and that she needed to understand the commitment of what it meant and the dedication, and she said, yes, this is what she wanted to do Well, that became five days a week, sometimes six, and she was made -- she went to team really quick because she was really good.  However, during -- she took a fall off of the beam and she injured her lower back and I asked our coach, I said, who should we go see?  And at this time she was ten years old.  And so -- and this was in .  And so they said, you know, go -- they referred us to Larry Nassar, and I said, okay.  Well, at the time we really didn't know, you know, much about him other than his medical reputation, so we went to see him and we traveled all the way from the east side of Michigan to Lansing, you know, several times a month for treatment. The last time that we went to treatment she was at that time  years old, and we had this thing, her and I, that we would, after her doctor visit, we would go to this little cafe in East Lansing and have lunch and enjoy each other for a while before we had that long drive back home, and so we got in the car -- and I had been in the room with her during her examination, as usual, and I said, are you ready to go to lunch and she's, like, no, mom, I just want to go home.  And I said, what's wrong?  Are you in pain?  And she said, mom, I just want to go home.  And I said, okay.  So we got in the car and I said -- and she started bawling and I said, Chelsey, tell me what's wrong.  And she said, mom, he put his fingers in me and they weren't gloved, and I said, Chelsey, I was right there in the room, and she goes, you couldn't see what was going on, mom.  And she said, he hurt me.  And I said, Chelsey, we're going back right now.  And I -- I mean, I was literally going to drive across the median on , and she said, mom, please don't do that.  I said, why?  And she said, because you don't understand, everybody will know, and everybody will judge me, and the judges will know when I compete, and I said, Chelsey, I can't do that, I have to go back.  Mom, please, we'll just find another doctor, and she begged me, and she was hysterical.  And I said, okay.  You know, I said, I'll talk to your dad about it, but I may end up going back, Chels.

And I said, well, Tim, it did happen.  So I told him I just wanted him to know what had happened.  So when I went into the balcony and was sitting with the rest of the moms, I said, You know, did any of your girls see Larry Nassar for treatment and a couple of them said, yes, and they said -- I said, did anything -- did they ever say anything about unusual behavior on his part?  And they said, well, no.  You know, they give me this look like you're lying to me, but anyways, that was neither here nor there at the time because they weren't going to say anything.  So we started a path of destruction, and her path of destruction was -- she was doing horrible in school.  She had this self loathing.  I had her see a psychiatrist and it didn't seem to be helping.  There was a lot of self blame.  She had managed to get through -- she had quit gymnastics the following year when she was  because she went to a meet here in Lansing at Twistars, I believe it was, and he was there and she fell off of every apparatus, she did horrible, and she said, I can't do this anymore because every time I see him I just flash back to what happened in his office. She made bad decisions.  It affected her social life.  She started running with bad crowds.  She got into drugs and she never really recovered.  The person that was my best friend, we used to do everything together, we would watch movies, we both loved movies -- as a matter of fact, I hate to admit it but on a rainy day we went to see four movies and only paid for one, but we would bake cookies together, and she loved the holidays, and she would decorate the house and I didn't have to do anything.  She just kind of, like, took over.  So she did come out of it a little bit.  She had suffered a rape at a concert, that was another thing that compounded her issues.  I think the thing that her -- the worst part for her was that this was a man that was supposed to be the best in his field.  He was supposed to help her.  He was supposed to help her heal.  But he didn't.  He abused her.  He sexually abused her, and he had the audacity to do that while I was sitting right there in the room.  I know that the other girls have similar stories.  We all have the same story, but for my daughter it just became a serious, serious bought of depression, and so in  she took her own life because she couldn't deal with the pain anymore, and it will be ten years in March that I lost my baby.  She was  years old.  She would have been  now.  And every day I miss her.  Every day.  And it all started with him.  It all started with him.  It just became worse as the years went by until she couldn't deal with it anymore.  And you don't know what it's like to be at work and get a call to come home immediately, and you know, a mother's instinct tells you something is wrong, and you pull up in your driveway and the medical examiner is there and your daughter is in a body bag and they're loading her into the van.  It has destroyed our family.  We used to be so close.  My husband and I -- I went through four years of intense therapy trying to deal with all of this until I could finally accept the fact that this was not my fault.  It was the fault of Larry Nassar that started all this with my daughter, and as you can see, she turned into a beautiful young lady who was really, really sick.  And that's my story for her.

      "  Your Honor, life through a child's eyes is a place where bad things don't make sense.  Rarely do you see or hear a child that doesn't smile at the thought of life.  A child is just what I was, a  year old who didn't see the world as a terrifying place, not until I was faced with the life changing experience that stole my innocence far too young.  Not until the day that you, Mr. Nassar, violated the right to be called a doctor and took something from I and all of the other strong women that stand behind me today. I was in a state of great desperation when I paid my visit to Doctor Nassar, or as he liked his patients to refer to him, Larry.  Prior to my visit I had been recommended by gymnastic coaches.  I heard words such as, you'll love him.  He's a miracle worker.  He can fix anyone or anything.  Thinking back to these words filling my naive mind, all I can think of is how this man, someone who held so many high credentials, was the monster who left me with more pain and scars than I came to his office with, the pain of never trusting someone physically again and the scars of being touched and exposed in places that were completely inappropriate.  That day in the office is a day that will never be forgotten.  My family and I drove from Naperville, Illinois, to Mr. Nassar's office at the Michigan State facility in Lansing, Michigan.  I can't begin to explain the feeling I had moments after this immoral act had been performed.  I got a moment to myself after the assault when I sat in the bathroom at the facility.  I sat there in great disbelief, complete shock, and total humiliation.  I couldn't fathom the idea of what had just occurred.  There isn't a day that goes by since July st, , that I don't cringe at the disturbing violation that this man had put me through.  This horrific headline had finally reached the media three years later of too many girls losing something that should have never been stolen; innocence, privacy, safety, and trust.  One day about three weeks after this had initially hit the news I was sitting in English class and we were discussing the meaning of the word depravity.  This word means wickedness or performing immorally corrupt acts.  The example my English teacher gave to further explain this disturbing word was this.  One day about -- excuse me.  The other day I saw in the news that an Olympic gymnastic doctor had -- that was the moment I was dreading, that moment where I had become the victim of a heartbreaking news story that my English teacher was casually discussing in class.  Of course, she was // \n",

      " AMPage  to  of  of  sheetsunaware.  Everyone was.  My face was filled with terror and panic as soon as the words Olympic gymnastic doctor filled the room.  I sat in my desk shaking as if I was back in that office being violated.  I previously described how this event stole my innocence, and that is what carries with me to this day.  For years I was afraid to give myself and my trust to anyone.  I wasn't willing to be heard again.  I had tried to hold on to every bit of innocence I felt I had left.  I was terrified to date anyone because I knew that physically and mentally I couldn't get past this internal barrier.  I was afraid to lose myself to another person who didn't deserve it.  Last year I found someone who took me in and handled me with great care.  I learned to trust his loving arms and appreciate the endless love he had for me despite my intimacy issues.  I finally feel as though I got my innocence back.  I gained back what I lost unexpectedly, and I'm grateful for that every day.  I'm speaking on behalf of all the girls who experienced this tragedy, whether it was one time or multiple times.  Once is far too much to be put through.  Some may be scared to share their experience.  I was.  I still am sometimes.  There are some days that this horrifying experience fills my brain and I can't think about anything else.  It left a mental scar that unfortunately will always be something that happened.  However, I am a strong believer that wounds heal into scars and these scars become stories that you share and heal from each day as time goes on.  A voice must be heard in order for all these victims of this tragic event to reach a level of closure.  Justice must be served.  I am speaking to all the parents out there, including my own, who could have been in the very room that this event happened but was manipulated into believing that Mr. Nassar was healing us, as any normal doctor is supposed to do.  You are not to blame.  I can tell you that the thought of, well, if my parents would have just done, has never crossed my brain, and I can speak of other daughters who experienced this as well.  To all the significant others of these girls, nothing means more to them than the way you love them and show them how to love themselves.  That is only going to help us heal, so thank you to both parents and significant others for going through these horrifying events with us and being there as a shoulder to cry on or a hand to squeeze tight.  To all the girls that have shown so much bravery throughout this, I could not be more proud of each and every one of you.  Although I may not know each of you personally, I can stand here and say that you are all my heroes.  Lastly, a few words to Mr. Larry Nassar.  You broke and shattered a lot of girls.  You manipulated us to trust you because you're a doctor and doctors do no wrong, only heal.  You are not a healer.  You performed acts of depravity just as my English teacher described.  You are also the one that must face what you have done for the rest of your life.  I am no longer broken by you.  Every day I grow a new strength and look into the mirror to see a strong, unbreakable person.  Nothing will ever take away what you have done to me or to the others that stand behind me.  However, we can walk free and radiate the strength that we have gained from your horrific acts, something you will never be able to do.  Although I no longer see the world through a child's eyes, I have become this powerful individual that is taking this opportunity to speak for what I believe in.  I am not the only one who suffered from these acts, and I know that this is not an easy thing to hear.  The fact of the matter is that it doesn't matter if this topic is uncomfortable to listen to or discuss.  It is something that happened and needs to be addressed,I am hopeful that this letter not only speaks to those in this room or those involved with this case but to anyone who hears of these headlines.  These acts were completely immoral and horrific and I am confident that Mr. Nassar will get what he deserves.  In the meantime, I hope that the effects that this tragedy has had on young girls is strong enough to make a change.  Initially when I was asked if I wanted to remain anonymous when I read my letter today I immediately thought, yes.  This is something about me that I have always been afraid to share with people.

Sadly, as you recognized and the other victims have recognized, you're not alone in this.  It happens all the time and, unfortunately, here it was with a trusted doctor who shouldn't have been trusted.  I can also see as you read your statement -- I know you don't have eyes in the back of your head, but I watched the faces of your parents.  They're also emotionally distraught but so very proud of you.  I can see it.  And that's so important to have them as your backup, your main people, and they're there.  Your scar turned into a powerful voice.  You're using it.  You're a role model and you're a hero for all children without voices, and your fellow victims, so I applaud you being here today, making the decision to go public.  It makes a difference.

      "  December , , I woke up from a nightmare sweating yet chilled to the core.  I knew before months of defending the mastermind I knew I was one of them.  That afternoon thousands of graphic images were found on multiple computers and media devices.  I still think about that daily.  For years Mr. Nassar convinced me that he was the only person who could help me recover from multiple serious injuries.  To me he was like a knight in shining armor.  But, alas, that shine blinded me from the abuse.  He betrayed my trust, took advantage of my youth, and sexually abused me hundreds of times.  For this I believe that Mr. Nassar deserves the maximum sentence for which his actions deserve.  As a nation we need to take control.  Sexual offenders need to know that they cannot continue with the crimes they are committing, and that no matter how long it takes for a survivor to come forward, their crimes will be exposed and their actions will be admonished.  Sexual assault and harassment should not be a part of our culture.  Mr. Nassar should never be allowed to look at, talk to, or touch another young person again.  I was an innocent nine year old with a broken pelvis that was willing to trust and allowed the doctor to do anything to help it feel better.  I had no reason not to.  He treated a few of my cousins.  He was friends with my mom and aunts.  He had pictures of Olympians and thank you notes from floor to ceiling in that MSU Sports Medicine office.  I gazed at them during every appointment.  I knew the story behind many of the portraits, he shared them with me.  I was the  year old preparing to go away to college, apprehensive, and just hoping my body would be able to withstand four more years of the sport that defined my life.  Ten years of abuse and neglect.  I don't like the word victim.  Being a victim implies the desire for pity.  I am a survivor, but more so, I am me, and those ten years are a part of my story.  They have helped to define who I am today.  Today I am more guarded than I was a year ago but I also am wiser and more aware.  Today it is my job to be an even better role model and mentor and to be an advocate in saying that this does not define the sport of gymnastics or the medical profession.  I have the honor of working with young girls every day.  They listen to what I say, get notifications every time I post to Instagram, analyze what I do, pick up on my vocabulary and copy how I dress.  It is my job to teach them to be humble and kind, strong willed and determined, gritty and confident.  It is my job to teach these girls that they can be the most powerful, amazing, and influential humans if they so choose and to help them realize that they have a voice and they have the ability to stand up for what they believe in.  It is my job to ensure that every nine year old I work with knows that she has an amazing future ahead of her and to ensure that every  year old I know realizes that she has the power to define who she is, that no // \n",

It is not my job to point out the flaws in the system and what others could have done to protect myinnocence.  That truth will one day be exposed.  But it is my job to make a difference and an impact on the world and to help stop monster-like humans from abusing their power.  I am working on forgiving you, Mr. Nassar.  One day I will be able to, but I will never forget what you have done.  I must ask you this, are you remorseful for your actions in all of the lives you have changed forever?  Do you regret misusing your medical dominance?  I could hear it in your voice that November day when you pled guilty.  You are sorry for the pain that you have caused.  You had the same sincerity as you told me the story of why you blame yourself for sweet ********** birth story, as you hugged me at your brother Mike's funeral, and all of those times you told me I just needed to rest and could not compete.  Saying that you did nothing for me would be a lie.  You helped to heal me.  My fragile bones, that is.  You shared your knowledge and gave me some invaluable advice, but you also abused your power and mytrust in you, and that is not okay.  My love for humanity is greater than the fear of the unknown.  My voice is louder than my inner thoughts.  My hope for change is more prevailing than my desire to ask why me, why was I the nine year old?  This past year I have had countless somber days and incredibly long sleepless nights.  I clenched my jaws as I heard strangers wonder how he really did what he did and turn the other way as I saw her face on the front page of the newspapers in the gas station.  I have held back tears when friends ask how I was holding up.  I have looked into my parents' hardened eyes, seeing their pain from now knowing that their only child was molested right in front of them in the same room.  When no one is around I have cried and sobbed, felt a rush of every emotion and solidified my belief that I have the most amazing family and an incredible circle of friends.  And I have had to think through and talk about the hundreds, hundreds of appointments and Nassar home visits and cringe at all of the times I should have said something about the improper treatments and oath breaking moments.  But I didn't, and I cannot look back anymore.  I am determined to be more involved in making this world a better place.  I can use my voice, my education, and my experiences to help stop females and males alike for not standing up for themselves and others.  After all, darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that.  Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.THE COURT\n",

      " AMdone.  My children and my husband get less than my best due to the many sleepless nights and layered days of scratching and clawing to stay afloat.  Prior to realizing what you had done to me I was a woman who once woke up each day with a smile, positive attitude, and end the day with just enough leftover energy to play with my children and successfully put a mark on another day.  I gave humans the benefit of earning my trust and most often took the time to see good in most people The past year has been nothing like those times.  My days start with exhaustion from a less than restful night's sleep and they end with fatigue from all the distractions and emotions that fill each day.  I have always believed that I can accomplish whatever life throws my way with a restful night's sleep, and I cannot sleep because of what you have done.  I have made jokes in the past saying that I've never witnessed a bad's night sleep and for that I was forever grateful for God giving me the ability to sleep soundly.  Over the last year I have cried more nights than not and I have experienced flashback nightmares of the abuse.  I've woken up from such bad nightmares that I vomit.  The anxiety this has caused me is what leaves me feeling like there is nothing more to give.  Today I am a mother, a wife, a daughter, and friend that is struggling each day to find peace and joy in all things that once made me happy.  Conversations are overtaken by Larry Nassar and the obvious pain in my voice is hard to avoid.  Those that truly know me know I will never be the same.  November of last year I began seeing a therapist for what I now know is post-traumatic stress disorder.  My deepest pain and fear was the thought of my two young daughters ever being hurt like this.  The fear that invoked was crippling.  I was unable to send my children to daycare due to the paralyzing anxiety I was experiencing.  And birthday parties, sleep-overs, large crowds of people steal the joy of creating memories with my family.  Some day I will have to explain to my children why I am the way I am, my reasons for being cautious and fearful.  My career has suffered tremendously from the distractions and the pain I am feeling.  There's not a day that passes that I don't think about the monster that created this mess.  The checklist of what needs to get done has never been harder to accomplish and some days the details seem like a nearly impossible task.  My mind is full of what is my new reality and my heart is aching from not being able to trust anybody around me.  For the past year I've held back with those that I love most.  I have become withdrawn from my every day life.  Life seems to be moving at a speed that I cannot keep up with and my peace of mind is forever taken away.  I will always sacrifice myself as a parent.  I went from once trusting full-heartedly to now not being able to trust at all.  The hardest battle I will continue to face is even in the situations you feel most safe, you can never let your guard down.  If you can't trust a world-renowned doctor, who in this world can you trust?  These feelings don't just stop from the abuse of Larry Nassar.  As if the struggle of what Larry Nassar did isn't bad enough, it's horrifying that MSU and USA Gymnastics are not stepping up to the plate to admit their wrongdoing.  I have gone from a raving fan of MSU to now seeing green and white in the very same way as I do Larry Nassar.  I want MSU and USAG to know what they have done is on the very same level of accountability as the crime Nassar has committed.  I strongly believe that MSU and USAG's inaction places an accountability on them for Nassar's access to minors which led to sexual abuse.  MSU knew what was being done to these athletes and decided to turn a blind eye to keep their reputation strong and their pockets full.  If they would have only taken action upon the reporting, they would have saved me and all of these other women standing before us today from an afterlife full of pain and agony.  As to what we now know of USAG, paying out to keep quiet is beyond my wildest dreams of wrong.  Shame on you for looking the other way when this was brought to your attention.  I'd like to take a moment to comment on MSU Board of Trustees as well as the president of MSU, Lou Anna Simon.  How convenient that you decided not to attend today.  You are a coward and your decision to watch from the sidelines is perfect representation of your lack of leadership.  It sickens me that for  months you allowed Larry Nassar to continue to see young children under your guidance while he was under investigation for sexual abuse.  Now that this is a // \n",

Have you ever thought to pick -- oh, sorry.  It would only make sense for you to speak directly to the victims to seek a better understanding of what had happened.  Not once have you reached out to gather information or to ask how we are doing.  We see how you're handling this matter, and I can tell you from a mother's experience that I expect better effort from my two young children.  A public apology after you hid behind this monster for over  years will never be enough.  Where were you when we needed you?  If you would have only listened to all the women that brought complaints and concerns over all these years this would have saved so many children and women from being abused and from all the scars this has created.  You have apologized for him and for the horrible things he has done.  That is not enough.  At what point will you look at yourselves in the mirror and realize that taking ownership of this matter is the only way to truly bring about change.  Until then, I will continue to fight for real answers.  Lou Anna Simon and the board of trustees, all the signs were there.  The complaints should have been enough for you to open your eyes and ears and to ensure that there was intentional follow through involved to protect the women under your care.  You failed all of us, and for that I see you in the same category of criminal as I do the criminal standing before us today.  On the other hand, I am beyond grateful for the sentence Nassar received.   painful years of prison life surely brings relief to me.  Knowing you will never have the opportunity to hurt another human being is reassuring.  As for the people at MSU and USAG, just know we will continue to fight to ensure that you're held accountable for not protecting young girls under your care from this day forward.   brings newness for myself and my family.  Even though I will never be the same, I will continue to fight for trust, love, and, most of all, peace of mind.  I will slowly but surely begin to feel, to feel the joy of new experiences with my children, reconnect with friends who over the last year have gotten less than my best.  I will make strides to love with an untainted heart that is ready for new beginnings.  The pain will never fully pass from what you and the irresponsible organizations have done to myself and many others.  There's still so much uncertainty in life, but one thing is for sure, I will continue to press forward to seek what was once happiness.  I will educate my children about monsters like you and pray to God they will never experience pain like this.  There will be a day when I look into my soul and I will still see the scars of this nightmare, but I will no longer feel the deepness of your pain.  The scars will remind me that the past is real but the future is bright.  Thank you.  THE COURT\n",

      "  Not playing was not an option, and my parents were obviously concerned, and through my mom's connections with MSU I was able to get an appointment with Larry.  I saw Larry once.  I remember him doing a scan on my body as I stood straight up in his office where he poked and prodded at me and he made various observations about my muscles and bone structure, et cetera.  My mom was in the room.  I was really into sports and, honestly, it was interesting to hear such a thorough examination of my body.  After the standing examination was done Larry asked me to lay down on the exam table and he positioned himself so that he was between my midsection and where my mom was sitting so she couldn't see what was happening.  He kept prodding at and manipulating my legs and hips and stomach and at some point he said he was going to move his hands close to my vagina.  I've thought a lot about that statement in hindsight and I see now how devious and how practiced it must have been for him.  My mom knew this doctor would be getting close so no cause for concern, and I was expecting something to happen but I didn't know what.  I had absolutely no other medical or personal experience against which to compare what he was about to do, and he didn't talk me through what he was doing, so he molested me and he molested me with my mom in the room.  My mom and I talked about the appointment afterwards but I didn't really have the words for what Larry had done, and as a  year old girl I was embarrassed to talk to adults about something like that.  I had never seen a gynecologist.  I never had a pap smear, and at the time I thought this is what it meant to be a woman going to the doctors, awkward and embarrassing and uncomfortable but just part of the deal.  Besides, I thought he was looking out for me.  It's been about  years since my appointment, and in that  years I have never had another health professional come close to touching me the way that he did.  At the time I had a sense that it was a strange appointment and if the university or police or someone actually looking to find something had asked either my mom or I about the experience, they would have put together a pattern of him acting far outside of normal behavior for a doctor, but no one asked us, and so after me, Larry had another  odd years to molest and assault young women and girls.

I knew that Larry Nassar molested me when I read the article in the IndyStar.  This last year and a half is about coming to terms with how naive and vulnerable I was.  I feel very stupid for not understanding what was happening at the time, really guilty for not contributing in some way to stop it sooner, and really, really emotional and vulnerable, but I also feel really lucky because I got to go through high school and I got to go through college and dating and I got to meet my future husband only thinking it was a weird doctor's appointment.  It's just in the last year that I've had to come to terms with what happened, but even in the last year it has changed me.  Larry's later victims knew they were victims at a much younger age so beyond molesting them, as you heard today, he's also robbed them of the innocence and carefree-ness that's supposed to come with that time in our life.  After today I don't plan to think about Larry unless I absolutely have to.  I get to keep living.  I get to keep looking forward to the future and what's next.  I get to keep having an incredibly rich and fulfilling life, and so do the other women who are here today, and so do the other women who haven't necessarily stepped forward, but that's not what he gets, and that's where I get my justice.  I'd like Larry to sit in prison for a very long time with no hope for what's next.I also want to say I was abused once a long time ago.  I did not understand it was abuse until I was an adult, and even with that, this past year has still been a very emotional and trying time.  I can't imagine how difficult it's been for the charging victims.  I don't want the women and families who testified against Larry to have to go through that again unless they want to, which is why I hope that even though these crimes warrant a lifetime or more in prison, you sentence Larry to the highest minimum of  years so that the plea deal is not jeopardized.And I also want to close by saying thank you to you, to Detective Andrea Munford, to Rebekah Snyder, Angela Povilaitis, to Rachael and IndyStar for shining a light on this and for the other women who stepped forward to end the abuse.

      " AMthe graphic details of what you did to me.  Each time I had to describe it, whether to the police, my attorneys, my therapist, or in writing, it doesn't get any easier.  Having to relive my experiences over and over almost  years later brings back so many memories and emotions.  I even avoid talking to -- talking about it with those close to me because I get closed off and irritable.  The fact that I was sexually abused by you is something that I'm still wrapping my head around.  One of the hardest parts is seeing my parents carry any sense of responsibility for what happened because it is in no way their fault.  It's your fault.  We all trusted Larry and are angry for the way you deceived us.  He's made it difficult to trust anyone.  The flashbacks of the hours spent alone in that exam room with him have at times kept me up at night.  My memories are vivid and it's hard to get images out of my head.  I remember how much it hurt but didn't want to speak up because I was afraid of what you would think of me.  I had to be strong.  When I told my mom that it hurt, she thought I was referring to the pain in my back, not the pain in my vagina from the excruciating hours of assault that just took place.  For the first time in my life I sought therapy because I've realized this is something that I am not able to deal with on my own.  My therapist has helped me find ways to cope with my anxiety and emotions, but, more importantly, she's helped me to stop blaming myself.  Larry, you are the one that should feel guilt and shame every day and have to live with that for the rest of your life.  Unfortunately, we as victims and survivors have to live with the damage you have caused for the rest of our lives, too.  Your Honor, I'm asking for the full sentence set by the Attorney General's office because I am a hundred percent confident that if he had not been caught, he would continue to do this for the rest of his life.

Victims don't often recognize harm, sexual abuse, and you went to him for pain -- for healing, and you didn't know.  No one faults you or any other victim for that.  You were a child.  And even when it happens to adults, often they block it out, don't recognize it, don't see it for what it is for a long time because it's so very personal, so very difficult, and you're only human, but you are a super human person for being here, all of the victims are for being here in public and saying what you did, so I applaud you, and I hope that although you've lost trust of so many people, that you trust the court to do the right thing.  I will.  I will make up my mind in a few days at sentencing when it comes to that stage, and I want everyone to know I'm going to honor the plea deal because I think everybody needs closure, not because I necessarily am happy with it, but the combined sentences I think will put your mind at ease, and hopefully you can trust the system, and I trust that you're going to have a very happy, fulfilled life.

I talked with my parents and sister and thought the women that reported the sexual assault must be mistaken.  Even though I did not know this at the time, I had also gone through the same abuse beginning when I was  years old.  Today I know I was in the first stage of grief, denial.  Denial that I could ever be a victim of sexual assault.  I was grieving that a person I respected and cared for had betrayed my trust, grieving the realization that I was sexually assaulted as a child.  Prior to and even after my unfortunate contact with Larry Nassar I thought of myself as someone that was good at reading people.  However, Larry Nassar is a master manipulator.

My mom blamed herself and felt she should have asked more questions and been more guarded and skeptical about procedures.  The thought of my mom hurting and blaming herself was heartbreaking for me because never once did I think it was her fault.  Anyone that has suffered sexual assault or loves someone who has needs to realize it's not their fault.  It is the sexual predator's fault, and in this case it is Larry Nassar's fault.  Even though I accepted this abuse was out of my control to prevent, it has not lessened my depression and anxiety.  There are nights I lie awake crying, fearful of the nightmares that may come when I fall asleep, and when I'm awake the nightmare of this reality, my reality, is not much better.  Not only am I depressed with the realization of what happened to me, I've had to go on living my same life with family and friends that have no idea what I'm going through.  Usually I'm a very outgoing and open person, but it's been difficult to be my true self without sharing this part of my past.  What motivates me to come forward is my strong belief that victims of sexual assault deserve to have a voice.  By publicly speaking out against Larry Nassar I'm not just speaking out for myself, I'm speaking out for all the girls and women of the past, present, and future that have been or will be affected by sexual assault A quote from Jasmin Kaur\n",

It's been a difficult road, to say the least, but I know in my heart our efforts will help women not only today but for years to come.  Difficult times can either strengthen or break a person.  I am proud to say that this experience, though extremely challenging and sometimes unbearable, has made me a stronger woman than I was before.  Through this strength I have learned to not be ashamed.  The only ones that should be ashamed are Larry Nassar and the institutions that enabled him and denied responsibility.  I am thankful to the women that spoke out before me and gave me the courage to publicly share myname today.  I am no longer ashamed of speaking out, I am proud to.  It is disgraceful that it has taken this long for these girls and young women to have a voice and for that voice to be taken seriously.  It sickens meto know that over  years ago this abuse, my abuse, could have been avoided.  However, no one took the accusations seriously, or worse yet, no one cared.  Due to the shameful negligence and indifference of Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics, myself and  plus girls and young women were sexually assaulted and abused by Larry Nassar.  Although being a part of this case and publicly speaking my truth are actions I'm very proud of, my life would have been much easier if Larry Nassar was never a part of it.  If he was charged and convicted two decades ago it would have saved myself, the other victims, and all of our families and loved ones from immense amounts of pain and suffering that will now carry with us the rest of our lives.

      "  Your Honor, Mr. Nassar sexually abused me over a number of years beginning when I was a young teenager.  He broke me.  He stole my innocence and exploited it for his own sick satisfaction.  All aspects of my young life was torn apart.  I struggled in silence, shame, and confusion attempting to put the pieces of my life back together, but I will never be whole again.  The pain of the abuse continues to make me feel broken, insecure, fearful, and overall worthless.  At times these feelings become completely overwhelming that I engage in self destructive behavior and thought about killing myself. Feeling worthless is an extremely difficulty emotion to describe.  I would like you to imagine a time you turned off all the lights in a room and it was pitch black for a few moments before your eyes adjusted.  Feeling worthless is like that pitch blackness but your eyes never adjust.  You are just stuck in the darkness, a dark and empty space, and the more you search for any kind of light, the deeper you go into the desolate, apathetic, and fearful trap the darkness created.  You blame yourself for not being able to pull yourself out of the darkness and, therefore, feeling -- a feeling of worthlessness increases.  For other individuals their eyes would adjust or they would eventually find a light.  This is not the case for me since this pitch blackness is in my mind and the darkness has grown and entailed itself in every facet of my life.  I have tried to fight back against this darkness to feel worthwhile and worthy.  From others' perspectives I may seem like hardened and accomplished.  I have achieved so much.  In  I graduated from undergrad.   I graduated with my first master's degree, and  with my second master's degree.  Then in  I graduated with my doctorate, but I never once felt worthy of my accomplishments.  I never walked during commencement because I'm not worthy of the praise, congratulations, and pageantry of such a ceremony.  I have previously engaged in self harming behaviors.  I have stayed in abusive relationships when I knew deep down that I should run long before I did run.  I have had good relationships that never lasted since I did not feel worthy of the honest and true love that was offered.  I was stuck in the pitch blackness even though the other person was trying so hard to turn on the lights.  The physical damage has also been monstrous.  In just the last four and a half years I have had three major back surgeries and too -- too many steroid injections and nerve ablations to count.  These real medical procedures were in the same area of my back that Mr. Nassar was supposed to be treating.  Because of Mr. Nassar's complete lack of empathy and caring for my physical well-being, I still feel unworthy of a pain-free life or at least a life with minimal pain.  What I have described is just a brief overview of my life.  To give you more context, Your Honor, the past year and few months have been the most difficult and trying time of my life as the sexual abuse resurfaced with even more intensity, and I have constantly relived the abuse.  Because of this I had to resign from my job as I fell deeper into depression and no longer wanted to live.  I was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and still suffer from nightmares, intrusive thoughts, anxiety, depression, hypervigilance, and much more.  I spent  days in a trauma treatment center as my symptoms could not be controlled with outpatient counseling.  After I received the treatment I desperately needed I had to move and restart my career and whole life from scratch.  The stress of constantly reliving the years have impacted my physical health.  I have stomach problems where I can barely eat anything on some days.  I have been hospitalized multiple times for back and chest pain and I developed a heart arrhythmia that has to be surgically corrected.  Even though I'm doing much better, I still have days where I call my mom crying, have difficulty socializing, and lack motivation to do anything.  Your Honor, may I now address the defendant?

Each one of us had a full life ahead of us and we are full of potential and possibilities.  This is one of the things that I find unique about this situation.  You were considered the best, and as a result of that, everyone that saw you had the utmost potential.  They came from loving, supporting families that were doing everything in their power to support them.  These kids had dreams, the means to achieve them, and were fighting tooth and nail to reach them.  They were the cream of the crop.  What you did altered critical parts of our growth into being healthy adults.  What you did has made us second-guess our own inner voice, our gut reactions, and our ability to have accurate perceptions of people.  You put massive obstacles in between us and greater happiness in our lives, having healthy romantic relationships, and having trust for others who truly want to -- truly want to help us.  You hindered the trajectories of our lives that we and our parents worked so very hard for and changed the rest of our lives in ways that we're still realizing and dealing with every day.  This is what makes this crime so heinous, the cost is so high and the damage is complicated and impossible to measure.  You did this to countless human beings over decades.  Most of our victims probably aren't aware of everything you did and what you're being held accountable for today.  Not many people look up their doctors they saw  years ago or  or  or five years ago.  I only found out because of a fluke.  I often wondered what the number of victims really is.  The number of people whose lives you altered does not stop with the victims.  It has also impacted the people closest to us in our lives.  We have no choice but to watch them suffer from this too.  Our mothers and fathers who wanted the best for us, our spouses and partners, our friends, all of us with so many people, for what?  More recently the price that the bravest of us had to have paid to get this out in the open.  They've had to publicly attach you and what you did to them to their names.  Every time someone Googles them, possibly for the rest of our lives, they will see the sickening things we're talking about here today; when they apply for a job, when they go on a first date.  They won't be able to be the ones to fully make the choice on when to talk to their kids about what happened to them.  This terrible part of their past is exposed to all.  In spite of this, they have spent so much time and energy to get to this day and prevent this from happening to others.  The strength of character that these people have shown is in stark contrast to who you've shown yourself to be.  To each and every person who has worked to get to this day, I sincerely thank you from the bottom of my heart.  I also thank everyone who has played a supportive role which really does make a world of difference.  I know our fight isn't over.  We're working to change the policies that allowed this behavior to span decades.  This type of crime is not new and the lack of policy to prevent it is inexcusable.  It is simply negligence.  If people -- if policy to prevent this was in place and was followed, it would have prevented this from happening to the majority of us.  Whistleblowers need to be taken seriously.  Reporting needs to be mandatory and documented, and this part is not difficult to figure out.  Policymakers have the power to prevent this.  They need to know this.

You took something from me that can never be replaced, can never be changed, can never be forgiven, and that was my youth and innocence.  You took advantage of me when I was most vulnerable, when I was most afraid, and when I was most trusting.  You manipulated me into believing that everything you did was okay, that I was supposed to trust you, and I was supposed to never question anything you did because you were a doctor.  And because you were my doctor, you took advantage of me.  You stripped me of my dignity, my youth, and my trust, all for your personal satisfaction.  Because of your actions my life has forever changed.  I have to live with the fact that I was a victim of sexual assault.  I was a victim of sexual assault by someone I trusted and by someone who was supposed to help me achieve my passions in life, but instead you physically and emotionally abused me.  I have to live with the consequences every single day for the rest of my life while you never once thought about how your actions would affect the innocent women you decided to take advantage of for your personal pleasure.  My childhood has forever been scarred while it should have been the happiest of times.  I have lost all trust in medical professionals because of your actions.  I have lost my dignity as a young woman, and I have lost trust in many relationships throughout my life because of something that happened when I was only  years old.  You have darkened one of my greatest passions in life, gymnastics, and it will forever be tied to your name.  Your name that will forever be remembered as a gymnastics doctor that abused and sexually assaulted me as a young woman.  As my life goes on and your life ends in prison, I hope that you will realize that your actions have not only affected my life but also all of the other brave women who have came forward.

However, in November when I sat at home with my hands shaking while watching the live feed in the first hearing you presided over I heard the most interesting, powerful words come from your mouth.  You said that you wanted every girl to heal and you would let us take as long as we needed to all come forward and speak out.  That gave me the courage to face the fact that I was abused by Larry Nassar at the Michigan State University Sports Medicine Clinic for many years as I came to him for medical help for my gymnastics injuries. I decided I wanted to have the courage to step forward and fully have this experience today so that I could heal and gain freedom and have closure from this confusing chapter of my life.  So, first of all, I want to thank you for having the foresight and the compassion to make this happen for all of us today.  THE COURT\n",

      "  For those of you here listening today, I am remaining anonymous because that gives me the peace of mind that I need right now, but as I stand here before you, Larry Nassar, I know that I am not anonymous to you.  You once knew me so well.  You knew my voice, my face, my body in ways that you should have never been allowed to know.  You knew everything about me.  Up until just a few years ago you were a confidant.  You were my close friend who always had my best interests in mind, whether it is about my injuries, my eating habits, my gymnastics practices, school choices, college decisions, career path, and all the way up to my family plans.  I know now that this is one of the surefire signs of a friendly sexual predator.  I know now that the word grooming is a bad word, a word that I should never had to research as an adult woman.  When I was young I did not recognize that the grooming you were up to for more than a decade with me was to manipulate me to allow yourself further access to my body, to take advantage of me for your own selfish pleasure.  Even though I tried to stop you many times, you continually established trust with me so you could continue to hurt me.  I had no idea that you took my love for gymnastics and my desire to stay out of pain and you used it against me.  I sometimes think if I can tell my younger self how much I was loved and valued when I was only  and when it all began while receiving treatment from Larry Nassar, then maybe I would have never been tricked into a friendship and support from a doctor that I thought really cared about my well-being with all of his heart.  But that is not the case here because it wouldn't have mattered in what state of confidence I ever was because he was a master at manipulating the situation to feed his selfish addiction of taking advantage of me any time he could.  I completely trusted him  percent.  I never questioned why he always asked the nurses or residents to leave the room even though he was known as a teaching doctor and it would have made much more sense for them to stay in the room to learn his techniques.  But those techniques were a facade to feed his addiction, and because of that, I have dealt with questioning every person that I have ever met.  I questioned that they had true intentions, and I never learned to really trust the actual trustworthy people in my life.  I am not confused any longer about his intentions.  I now understand that he had a lifetime  of  sheetsPage  to  of // \n",

      " says, And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his internal glory in Christ, he himself will restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you.  I did, however, deal with a sense of guilt only due to the fact that I previously thought that if I would have spoken up more or louder then somebody would have listened at Michigan State University.  But I did tell a coach while on my gymnastics team at MSU and Kathie chose to put Larry's name, her identity, and the university's reputation above the choice to protect me.  My concerns and fears were minimized by those in authority positions at MSU, but now I don't have to carry that guilt any longer.  I was child.  I did my best, and I did speak up.  Even if I said it louder or more often, it wouldn't have mattered because we can see now that many girls and women spoke to people in authority at MSU and they were not heard.  This is so devastating.  This is a miscarriage of justice.  May we all learn from this that if a child ever comes to us about any type of unusual feeling coming from any adult, we will never brush them off.  We will listen to their every word and we will show them that we care and that we want to help them by taking immediate action for them.  May our state, our community, and especially our university learn from this horrible sequence of mistakes that children should be protected always and at all costs.  We have to find the positive.  Larry Nassar's actions and MSU's negligence will be the reason for a change in a society filled with secrets and confusion.  Because of the brave women and girls and friends and parents and family members that are here today that have stepped forward to bring truth and light to this dark secret, we will now see a change.  We will know how to recognize a person of extreme status and high caliber can also be one that causes extreme hurt and trauma and is utterly dangerous with repercussions that last a lifetime.  I believe the real tragedy here is not just that one man was extremely sinful in nature but that MSU did not have the proper checks and balances in place.  They somehow managed to glorify a criminal and ignore the signs.  Instead of private investigations, myself and several other girls were told by the MSU staff that we were wrong.  We grew up watching MSU promote and glorify a child pedophile.  MSU enabled, paid, and promoted him to live out these terrible acts.  We were repeatedly shut down with our attempts of stopping this man.  As I am now a mother, I can say that there is absolutely no excuse for this.  Regardless of how insignificant a child's plea for help may have seemed by MSU, I don't understand how this history could have went on for more than two decades.  These are the answers that I demand.  This is the change that needs to happen right here in our community so that growth will happen at other institutions.  If all of us survivors' pain and suffering prevents and protects other children, then it will not be wasted.  I have freedom not to be afraid anymore.  I will be free from the chains of control from a man that will never have access to me or any girl ever again.  And I am free from worrying what will happen to Larry Nassar.  His actions have caught up to him and God will deal with him now for what he sees best.  I believe he needs the maximum sentence for his actions and so that future predators will remember this story and choose to stop violating children and get help.  The truth is out and we can use this truth to overcome evil and make sure these things will never happen again.  For all of those that covered for him, enabled him, or turned the other way while I saw him at Michigan State University, I hope your actions will come to light and you can come out with the truth to make our university and community a safer place for children and women.  And if you choose not to, I know at some point your actions, too, will catch up with you.  Our God is a just God and he will bring mercy and healing to all of us that need it.

      "  Unlike most of the women in this room who were and are accomplished gymnasts, when I was a teenager I was an elite vocalist and I would spend most of my time in different choirs, ensembles, and musicals, solo competitions, and eventually being recruited to sing for Michigan State.  One of the biggest things I believe to change during this time is I began to become afraid of my own ability to write and to perform.  I believe that through the confusion and self disgust I felt for repeatedly -- from what repeatedly happened to me I slowly lost the certainty I had in my ability and my passion for being on stage and for writing music.  I could no longer handle the vulnerability it took to perform on a regular basis.  By the time I turned  the only performing I did was bar singing in which I could use alcohol as a sedative for my nerves, and I haven't been able to finish writing a song since I was .  In addition to taking some of my love of music it is because of Larry and his misuse of trust that I stopped playing soccer.  Soccer was always my favorite sport and the sport I was most talented in.  When I began seeing Larry in  he sent me to get a bone scan in which he told me it came back showing a stress fracture in my lower spine.  I was to wear a back brace for much of that year.  He used my stress fracture as the reason to tell me I needed to continue seeing him, stop playing soccer, and that my back was too fragile, and with the right slide tackle I would end up paralyzed.  I put full trust in him, as you generally would a doctor who was told was the best, and stopped playing soccer.  When getting my medical results for this legal process I found the statement no fracture is seen in multiple place from other doctors in my medical file.  It is incredibly angering to realize the sport that I love beyond words was taken from me for a reason that I now believe was completely false and only used to keep me as a patient for his personal gain.  In addition to not playing soccer throughout the last  years due to false information, I also lived my life more cautiously believing that my body was more fragile than it was.  Another one of the things that I feel Larry has taken from me is my sense of self confidence and assurance in my own ability, judgment, and physical strength.  I worked hard to accomplish many things throughout my life but I've since struggled to be proud or share what I accomplished with others.  Not only does this hurt me on a personal level but has been an issue looking for employment.  I often cower to the ideas of male co-workers, especially supervisors, or avoid being put in a position where I would have to work in close proximity with men, sometimes even leaving positions when I feel like it is too much.  Instead of taking opportunities to work late, when I often know it would just be me and male co-workers in the building, I leave immediately, often to the effect of being behind in my work so that I am never alone.  This has gotten exponentially worse over the last year after reliving everything through an adult's eyes.  For the last  years I have struggled with trust and intimacy with others.  Generally it takes me a long time to fully trust anyone and possibly years before I really share anything truly emotional and vulnerable about myself, which I used to do regularly and took a lot of pride as an artist to do so.  Physical touch has since been a huge problem for me.  I get anxiety before large family events and holidays knowing that I will most likely be touched and hugged by those I love.  Something that should be joyful and relaxing is often anything but.  When touched unexpectedly even by those closest to me like my husband, my initial reaction is defensive and it takes a while for my nervous system to calm down.  In addition to the anxiety being brought on by touch, I often feel a lot of guilt and self loathing for being so guarded and unloving to those closest to me.  In the last year since the news broke I had to come to terms with a lot of what exactly happened to me  years ago, and I lost a lot of trust in those around me.  Aside from close friends, I've had a year of avoiding conversation, touch, sharing what is going on in my life.  I often find myself replaying horrible flashbacks in my head trying to make sense of it all.  It has caused a lot of anxiety, depression, recurrent nightmares, and a lack on my personal relationships.  One of the major issues that has occurred // \n",

      " AMPage  to  of  of  sheetsrecently is that I have -- I have always had anxiety when being around male doctors but it has gotten exponentially worse, and as someone who has gone through infertility testing and currently pregnant, it becomes exhausting to have to constantly advocate to have a female doctor and explain why it's necessary when somebody doesn't take you seriously.  If I'm unable to see a female physician, I generally have intense anxiety leading up to and during the exam.  For example, a couple months ago I had gone in for an HSG test and was only able to get a male doctor.  They allowed me to have two young techs with me at the time, but I had so much anxiety having a gynecological procedure done by a male, between that and the pain, I passed out on the table almost immediately after it started.  My heart rate and blood pressure were so low the office had to call my husband to come get me.  It is ridiculously embarrassing to have to take extreme precaution for my medical care.  I generally thrive in high stress situations and intentionally work in such, but when it comes to my own medical care, the simplest issue is paralyzing.  It has also made the process of making a birth plan with my hospital unnecessarily very complicated and I fear what the added anxiety from this case and what I live with day-to-day will do to my daughter.  I have also lost a lot of the love I had for coming back to my hometown and the passion I always held for being a Spartan.  Coming back to East Lansing has always been a fun and exciting time for me.  I see friends and everything.  And even though we live out of state, it was important for my husband and I to come back to campus and be married there, but it has now turned into reliving what happened to me years before the entire time.  I no longer look forward to spending my weekends watching sports with friends, which has always been a large pastime of mine and has been a hobby since I was young Overall this trauma has caused me a great deal of depression, anxiety, recurrent nightmares, intimacy issues, loss of enjoyment in loved activities, issues at work, feelings of guilt, shame, low self esteem and self worth, and occasional suicidal thoughts.  It has caused feelings of guilt and depression in my family members, especially my mother who knows this has to do with the pain that she was in the room at the time, and added unnecessary strain on my closest relationships.  These things that happened to me in his office long ago were not short-lived, uncomfortable moments.  They were lifelong traumas that has changed the way I walk in the world.

      "  Okay.  As for the details of myencounter with Nassar, unfortunately those are more difficult to forget.  A little history about me.  Though legally an adult at , I was still very much a kid when I came to Michigan State.  I left school, one, having kissed two boys and, two, armed with my dad's permission to punch anybody in the nose who tried to put his hands where he shouldn't.  Going in as a freshman I was pretty naive.  I was desperate to compete and I wanted to get better.  I was considered a star player coming out of high school and expectations were high for me when I first entered the program.  So when my performance was not up to par -- I sat on the bench first half of the season -- I felt like I was letting my team down so I worked harder, practiced more.  Just like everyone in this room, you want to get on the floor and compete.  The rigors of training began to take a toll on my body and I battled shoulder inflammation along with back and leg injuries.  I was highly motivated to heal and I wanted nothing more than to compete to mypotential for the benefit of my team.  Sports medicine was new to me so who was I to question it?  Growing up in my family you went to the doctor if, one, you were dying, two, you broke a bone, or, three, you were due for a checkup.  Other than my high school athletic trainer who occasionally iced and taped up my ankle, my experience with sports medicine doctors was obsolete at best.  We treated // \n",

      " AMPage  to  of  of  sheetsour sprained ankles, jammed fingers, and pulled muscles at home.  Coming under the care of sports medicine doctors was a new experience for me.  I was absolutely blown away by the program and how well they took care of their student athletes.  So here are the details of the incident as I remember them.  To the MSU volleyball team Doctor Nassar was jokingly referred to as the crouch doc for his unconventional methods of treating back and hip pain.  The buzz around Jenison Fieldhouse is that he was somewhat of a wizard, a nationally recognized doctor with great success in his field of expertise.  It seemed like the doctors at MSU were always in demand, especially Doctor Brumm and Doctor Nassar, so when I was squeezed in to see the doctor with the miracle treatments, I was very grateful.  Again, this was back when Jenison had medical trailers for a brief time because our training room didn't have adequate private space for doctors visits.  I remember having the option of keeping my Spandex on, which I was very grateful for and chose.  He had me lay down face down on the medical table.  When he started treatment I remember him saying his treatment relied upon applying pressure to areas around the pelvis and that this was normal, so when he went down there I just told myself it was normal, that he knows what he's doing, and don't be a baby.  I remember he first started with pressure -- excuse me.  Excuse me.  He first started with pressure points around the outside of my vagina and around my pubic bones.  He said he was trying to relieve pressure and something about nerve endings in that area being related to the back.  He would just ask me questions and talk about life, his work, and how he used this method to help some.  However, during the procedure I am now choosing to report, he just gradually moved in, pressing through and stretching my Spandex with his fingers as he entered through my vaginal opening.  I remember laying there wondering, is this okay?  This doesn't seem right.  Should I say something?  What's happening?  I didn't know what to do.  He just kept on talking about life like when you go to the dentist and they talk about random stuff to try to make you feel at ease.  He didn't say anything out of the ordinary, he just did it as though he was doing something as mindless as riding a bicycle.  There are two arguments at war in my mind, this doesn't seem right versus he's a world-renowned doctor and he's treated so many athletes.  Everyone knows he treats down there and they don't complain so just stop being a baby.  Everyone trusted him.  I told myself I needed to trust him, too, so I convinced myself it was just a normal part of the procedure and kept my mouth shut.  However, I could not have prepared myself for what happened next.  Originally I was very hesitant to share the details of this part.  I did not want to give Nassar or any other sexual predator the opportunity to relive any details but I think this is a huge problem in society today that there are people that are hesitant to speak up because they think a victim wanted to be assaulted.  And that's just not true.  So in my opinion this is the worst partAgain, growing up in a culture with little experience of my own, I assumed something like what happened to me would only happen if I wanted it to.  Now that I'm a grown woman with friends in the medical field, I know this is not true at all from a medical standpoint, but what I knew at the time was based on magazines, movies, culture, and other teens just joking about it.  To be clear, during that appointment Nassar put direct pressure on places I didn't know existed at the time and my body reacted.  I didn't want it to but it reacted anyways, and as it was happening I remember laying there frozen stiff on the table utterly mortified, confused, and scared.  I felt so powerless to control what was happening.  My mind was willing one thing, for it to stop, and my body was doing another thing, not stopping.  And all the time I had no idea whether or not he was aware of what was happening.  He just kept on with his treatment as if nothing had happened.  I didn't move until the treatment was over and then I tried my best to pretend nothing happened and left as quickly as I could.  The initial aftermath.  In the aftermath questions raced through my mind a mile a minute trying to make sense of it all.  What just happened?  Trying to desperately understand why I couldn't control what was happening to my body.  Could my body really react that way if I didn't want it to?  I thought that was impossible, but clearly it wasn't because it just happened.  If it's not supposed to happen like that, what does that say about me?  Was I sick or something?  Did I need help?  I felt like my body had just betrayed me, and I had built up such a wall of protection in my mind around Nassar that my first reaction was to question myself, to blame  of  sheetsPage  to  of // \n",

I wanted to believe the best in people, but no matter how much I rationalized, he's a doctor, he's trying to help you, you should be grateful he's treating you, he didn't mean for it to happen, I couldn't shake the voice in my head that said something wasn't right.  But how could I tell someone?  I was so afraid if I told someone the truth that they would think I was lying, that they would think I was one of those athletes just looking to stir up trouble.  I was scared they would draw their own conclusions, they would believe the only way for my body to react in that manner was if I liked it, if I welcomed it, or if I wanted it.  I knew -- I was afraid that people would look at me differently.  I was fearful of being looked down upon, of being labeled.  I was fearful a man wouldn't want me after that.  That no man would want me.  People would think I was messed up.  I would be deemed unlovable, unacceptable, and what if what Doctor Nassar did was unintentional?  What if my body was just abnormal?  Again, I was young, inexperienced, and I didn't know there was a spot inside your body that triggered that type of response.  I feared the possibility of accusing an innocent man, that I could ruin a good doctor's reputation and career for performing a normal medical procedure.  He couldn't control how my body reacted, or could he?  Could what happen be some abnormal freakish side effect or something?  But what if it wasn't?  It was all so confusing, but in the end I decided to go to my trainer, Lianna, or Lili as we affectionately called her, and ask if there was a way for athletes to file a general complaint just stating that they were uncomfortable with their doctor's visit.  Again, all I wanted to do was say I'm uncomfortable and to have that heard and recorded with the small hope that I wasn't alone.  So when I came to her asking her if I could file a general complaint, she treated the situation with both seriousness and sober-mindedness and tried to walk me through the process the best way that she knew how.  She asked me all sorts of questions, did Nassar do something you thought was criminally wrong?  Did he hurt you?  I remember trying to answer as truthfully as possible, but I was so scared of revealing what I thought were shameful details that I didn't give her much to go on.  In the end, she wanted to make sure I correctly understood what filing a report would involve; an investigation, making an accusation against Nassar, and stating that I felt that he did something unprofessional or criminally wrong.  At the time I couldn't say I -- could I say that with certainty?  I had a hard time saying that with certainty.  I just wanted to say I was uncomfortable and have it recorded.  I wasn't aware of a way to do that without making a formal accusation and exposing those mortifying details to the world, so instead of filing a report, I came up with a plan for the future.  If I ever had to be treated by the doctor again, I would be forthright and clear.  If he tried to go there, I would speak up.  I would say I was uncomfortable, and I resolved in my mind if he proceeded to cross a boundary after that, I would drop kick him in the face.  Armed with this initial resolution, it just felt safer to move on.  I'm sorry, I'm breaking from this for a minute.  And then you come in here and you see all these beautiful, young women, these little girls -- I'll get to that later.  Just stick with it.  Go.  Okay.  So why am I now choosing to report this?

      "  Thank you.  When I first heard about it my initial instinct was to send a group chat to my teammates.  I knew some had been treated by him, and I wanted to make sure no one was as oblivious as I was.  It sparked a conversation and I found myself once again faced with a decision to speak up.  Memories began to resurface and I found myself having to revisit the scenario once more again under different circumstances.  With a sexual experience of a woman married nearly  years and armed with the realization far more athletes had similar experiences to my own, I now find it very hard to believe that Doctor Nassar, as a recognized medical professional, did not know those spots were there and that he was unaware of the changes that were happening to me when I was lying face down on that medical table, so I called my church mentor, a physical therapist at Botsford Hospital in Metro Detroit, and through uncontrollable sobbing I began to painfully unearth and recollect the incident I had so decidedly buried years ago.

Gradually over the period of a few days I faced my fear, opened up to select friends, family, and my team about the incident.  The love and support I received from them has been overwhelming, especially from my husband who's been an un-formidable rock of protection, love, and understanding through this process.  If I were to put someone else in my shoes, I feel like I could easily understand her situation, her emotions, and reluctance to speak up, but it's a little bit more difficult when you're the one in those shoes.  The past few weeks -- so this is when I initially made my report in May, so during that time period and since it's been a roller coaster of emotions.  I constantly ask myself, did I have the power to stop him?  Did I have the power?  Could my voice have been the one that broke the chain of abuse and stopped him in his tracks?  Even now speaking the truth is, admittedly, difficult.  It's vulnerable.  It's risky.  People might still arrive at their own misguided conclusions, and I'm powerless to stop it.  However, I'm convinced it's the right thing to do.  Even though my case may be  out of a hundred similar cases, I want to stand with all women who came forward before me and after me if just to say you're not alone.  And speaking up for my loved ones, my nieces, my nephews, my family, brothers, sisters, friends, I pray they would never find themselves in similar circumstances, but should that day come, I want them to be courageous, truthful, and to speak up without shame.  I am speaking simply to stand for truth and to face fear and to refuse to give fear a foothold any longer.

      "  Getting all of this on paper and preparing for this has been no small feat.  The amount of energy and emotional toll required to process and digest all of it has been completely draining.  I agonized for hours whether or not to speak in person, processing the potential repercussions and how my actions and decisions to speak up would affect loved ones around me, the opinions people have of me.  I wish I could say this was it, that this crime would no longer affect me or myloved ones, that I could forgive once, find closure, and simply move on, I just want it to be over, but, unfortunately, it's not that easy.  The truth is that once the gavel comes down and the sentence is revealed, for me the battle is not over.  Memories remain and a sense of uneasiness and uncertainty has been created from the choice to come forward, to stand, and to be counted.  How does one gain victory over memories?  You can battle memories but you can't erase them.  We try to keep them at arm's length, stop, locked someplace outside the boundary of our daily lives.  However, despite all our effort to squelch, bury, and forget, those memories remain and they find a way to invade at the most inopportune times.  They have no scruples, no manners, or decorum.  All it takes is one trigger to unlock the door and those memories rush in like a flood.  Sometimes during even our most private and intimate moments they rush in unwelcomed with the ability to make us feel just as ashamed, just as embarrassed, small, and powerless as we felt when the incident first happened.  While I have hope to find peace and gain quicker victory over the emotions that accompany those memories, fighting to remain at a place of peace will be a battle I fight for the rest of my life.  Memories like that try to accuse you at every opportunity.  During this season of life, this is my reality.  By making a decision to speak I must not only face the memories of those events but unearth, revisit, and reassess all the details I so decidedly buried years ago.  There were things I didn't understand and things I made excuses for, because, quite frankly, I was afraid.  And processing it all has been both painful, damaging, liberating, and terrifying all at once.  For the longest time my story was hidden.  No one could hurt or judge because no one knew.  Now it feels -- well, not feels, everyone knows.  Try to imagine yourself stripped naked, exposed to the world standing in a room filled with people examining you, judging you.  I kept my secret away for years because of fear.  I imagined the worst thing that could happen and the risk felt too great.  I'm still convinced my decision to stand for truth, to silence shame, and to be counted is the right thing to do, but I didn't anticipate -- what I didn't anticipate was that this resolve to stand for truth would be challenged in my own mind every single time I chose to share my story.

      " AMto others, it's not without risk.  You hear it over and over.  It's a safe place.  Safe?  You want to believe that.  But no matter which way you slice it, you're still standing there naked in the middle of a room vulnerable revealing some painful details to people, people who have both the power to heal and hurt, restore and ostracize, support and reject, or bully and blame, and you're powerless to control their reactions.  Simply observe children out on a playground and you'll learn very quickly human beings do not need a reason to be unkind.  So if history dictates that a storm might be coming and that people could be both unkind towards you and towards the loved ones that stand up for you, you brace for impact, and this is the tumultuous aftermath.  It is paranoia and the fear of not being accepted.  It's dealing with the swirling, raging, chaotic storm of thoughts and fears that accompany one's choice to be vulnerable and being forced to face the uncertainty that comes from an unavoidable reality.  What was hidden is no longer hidden, and because of that, circumstances in your life could be different than they were before.  I didn't anticipate that I would second-guess myself, that I would second-guess my relationships, and even the thoughts of those closest to me.  I found -- it's not difficult to imagine what people are thinking.  Granted, saying, hey, I know what you must think before people have had a chance to express their opinion isn't exactly fair, but it's not difficult for my train of thought to go down that track.  As a result of what's happened with Doctor Nassar I need to fight harder to trust those close to me and equally hard to make insignificant the opinions of those that would come against the truth of who I am.  And that's a whole separate level, my own thoughts towards myself.  You're faced with the realization that you could have said something and didn't because you were afraid, ignorant athletes.  We're supposed to be brave.  We're supposed to be strong.  But you were a coward.  Your dad is a police officer, you should have known better.  You made the wrong choice.  You see, it's not that difficult for our own hearts to condemn us either.  I have battled guilt of not speaking up.  I questioned my ability to make sound decisions, and I needed to face the truth that, yes, I was scared.  But I was recently reminded by a friend of a passage I love in my bible.  It's  John, \n",

Even if our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts.  He knows all things.  So my conclusion, I'm still searching for healing, for wholeness.  I know it's there for me but at this point in time I can't see it fully, but I'm battling for it.  Every person who has come forward must find their own way to stand under the weight of it all.  As an athlete, I was trained to battle, to be a warrior, to fight and overcome, so for me in my mind I find myself engaged in an all-out war against any accusation that might come against the truth of who I know myself to be.  As a Christian I have every reason to hope, yet right now I'm fighting to believe that.  When my heart condemns on every side, when that train of thought starts barreling down the tracks a hundred miles an hour with no sign of stopping, what's left to me is to step out in front of that train, root, ground myself in the truth of who I am, and stand firm in that foundation and push back.  I am loveable.  I am wanted.  I am significant.  I am accepted.  I am valuable.  I was made to love God and love people without fear.  Depression is not my portion but joy and hope are my portion.  The road to healing looks steep from where I am standing now, but I am a warrior.  There are unformidable truths that God says about me that no man can steal or spoil, so I arm myself with these truths.  They're a sword in my arsenal and I know the end of the story for me.  I will win, but I'm still -- right now I'm still in the fight.

      "  When given the opportunity to speak in front of this courtroom I was at first hesitant.  I wondered how this might affect my future, my career, the loved ones in my life.  I took a step back and realized that, once again, I was letting the fear, the shame, and the guilt own me.  I decided it was time to stand up to Larry Nassar and to those that enabled him to continue down this ravaging path of sexual abuse.  Today I am here for me and to be an advocate for the women and young girls whose voices have been silenced for so many years.  I remember the first time Larry Nassar  of  sheetsPage  to  of // \n",

      " AMsexually assaulted me.  It is not something easily forgotten, the intense sense of terror, anxiety, and disbelief came washing over me.  I lay there in pain unable to speak, staring blankly at the wall, desperately searching for a way to escape.  I kept repeating in my head, this is a mistake, this isn't real.  I thought, he's a famous doctor, there's no way he would do something inappropriate in front of my mom.  Well, I was wrong.  He used his power and position in society to earn our trust so that he could use us for his own sexual pleasure and gratification.  These, quote, treatments happened over and over again, eating away at my innocence as a child.  I was just a young girl with big dreams.  Aspiring to be the best figure skater I could be.  This is what I received in return for my dedication to the sport.  A sport that I loved so much, tarnished with vile memories.  I'm not sure I could even ever look at figure skating the same again, which is a shame because the sport essentially defined who I was as a child.  I have always struggled with intimacy in relationships because of what Larry Nassar did to me.  I have vivid flashbacks of him assaulting me.  Sometimes I can't even tolerate another person touching me in an intimate situation without feeling physical pain and experiencing these visual flashbacks.  I'm in the room again, on that table, reliving these events to this day.  I feel disgusting.  I find it hard to trust not only those I have been in intimate relationships with, but also those in positions of power.  I wonder who might betray me next?  Because if he could pull this off, then who's to stop anyone else from hurting me, too.  I have poor self-esteem and I experience frequent episodes of anxiety and depression.  When I see someone that looks or sounds like him, my heart races, just like it does before I have one of my beloved panic attacks.  Sometimes I feel a sense of guilt because somehow I wonder if it was my fault that all of this happened?  Relationships with my family members have suffered especially since all of this has become public.  The nightmares about what he's done have haunted me night after night.  As I sat down to write a statement, I asked myself, how can I put this horrific experience into words?  There are no words for this.  Despite these unfortunate events, I wanted to be clear that I will continue to overcome this.  I will grow as a person.  I will succeed in my career, and my family will flourish because his facade has been broken.  I am in charge now.  It has been hard accepting what Larry Nassar did to me.  I'm angry and I'm sad, but I will not be silenced anymore.  I encourage the court to enforce a minimum sentence of  years up to the maximum allowable sentence in prison.  It is imperative to show our society that sexual abuse will not be tolerated, and that we value the importance of bringing proper justice to those who have suffered by the actions of others.  But we cannot stop here.  Those who have enabled Larry Nassar in his general and high lifestyle need to answer to us as well.  Michigan State University must take accountability for their absence in putting an end to this abuse scandal.  MSU recently stated that no one affiliated with their university, quote, believed that Nassar sexually abused anyone until the news articles in .  Well, there's a difference between not believing and something seeming unbelievable.  Either way, they had the knowledge of the abuse, and their duty was to report it and take action.  If this had been appropriately addressed, I wouldn't be here talking to you today.  Something has gone severely wrong at MSU.  They have ignored us and their lack of action shows us that they stand behind a serial sexual abuser.  I had higher expectations for my alma mater.  Until then, we will do our best to heal, but I'm afraid for the safety of future students and athletes if MSU does not take ownership in their part to this story.  I hope today shed some light into the darkness that I have lived through, and I hope to give hope to those who have been through the same.  I am strong, and together we are even stronger.

I was a patient of Doctor Nassar from  through August of .  Today I can say that I am finally ready to face you.  Rather than someone that I used to trust, I am looking at a monster that took advantage of me.  I have a question for you.  Why?  Why did you feel that you could do this to us, and not only get away with it, but you also felt that you were allowed to?  You were the adult.  You were the doctor.  You were also someone that many people told me could fix my medical problems.  Instead, you groomed us into believing that you cared about us, but really you were just fixing your sick thoughts and fantasies.  I remember even lying to you at times saying I wasn't in too much pain just because I didn't want you to do the procedure.  I didn't know why I was asking this or lying to you.  I just knew something wasn't right.  You were truly sick.  I am coming forward so you can no longer hurt anyone else and take things away that you took away from me.  Ever since I realized what you were actually doing to me, it has been hell.  I have put my family and friends through hell.  I've also lost jobs because of how much you have affected me and put me through.  I have to rethink everything.  I have no trust left for anyone because you took that away.  How do I ever trust meeting new people after learning that someone I trusted for years has betrayed me and also took advantage of me?  So why on earth would I ever trust anyone again?  I try every day to overcome this, but every day is still a struggle.  More importantly, though, it's what this has done to my family.  We have to work on our relationships every day because now I tend to be so distant and push them away.  I would have never done this before.  But now I have, unfortunately, became really good at it because I still don't want to face what you have done to me and how much it affects me daily, so therefore it's just easier to be by myself.  I truly hope with all of us coming forward and finally saying what we need to say to you makes you realize what you have done.  I hope you think about it every day just like I do.  I want this all to go away.  I want the nightmares of you coming into my room to go away.

This one year -- this one month in ' we were at a competition and I ended up fracturing and dislocating my coccyx bone, my tailbone, and went over to see him the following day, and I had seen him before for, like, some wrist-type injuries, things like that.

I didn't know.  But I just remember being in so much pain, tears streaming down my face, holding on to the table just shaking, and I felt like I didn't -- I didn't know what to do.  My mother and him were having a conversation this whole time just about whatever, life, and it seemed like forever, went on forever, and finally he pulled his hand out anally and then inserted them vaginally, and that's when I knew there was a difference at that point and that he had his fingers in both places. // \n",

I went back to see him a couple weeks later, feeling better, and he says -- we didn't do an x-ray, didn't do any x-ray -- he said, it's out of place, again I need to redo the procedure, and I remember just being completely scared.  You know, I didn't want to go through that again.  I did not want to go through that.

Like, you know, all the other women were saying, you just believe that he's doing what's best for you, what's right for you.  Being that young, just trust, and he was very well respected and everybody talked so highly of him, so back in the gym I remember people whispering about what had happened because at that point it went around to everyone.

So, you know, this happened when I was .  I'm now .  And I have four kids of my own, and I've had so much depression over my life, over the years, I think that was my biggest struggle, severe depression.

I just want other girls to be safe -- other people, not just girls, other athletes, even boys to be safe from sexual predators from this kind of abuse, and, oh, I do forgive you, too, Larry.  I believe in forgiveness.  I'm not going to carry that for the rest of my life.  I'm not.  I have important things to do as a mom.  I have some really great people in my life.

And I am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse of the man who sits before me today, Larry Nassar.  Larry, it has been many, many moons since our paths last crossed.  I stand here today as what I understand to be one of the earliest reported cases of sexual abuse at your hands.  I think it is important to what I want to say to you today to start from the beginning.  Something I never realized about you is that your relationship with the sport of gymnastics, and thus little girls in leotards, started in your high school years when you worked as an athletic trainer starting in  for which you somehow earned a varsity letter in women's gymnastics, thanks to your work with the team.  Seven years later in  your relationship with the sport of gymnastics and little girls in leotards would continue.  This time in the greater Lansing area at Great Lakes Gymnastics Club.  You were three years out of college.  I was eight years old.  As our volunteer athletic trainer at Great Lakes you practically lived in the gym.  You were there almost every single day for hours with your big black medical bag full of supplies over your shoulder.  You arrived to the gym early to tape our ankles and shin splints and stayed late to tend to the rips on our hands and our pulled muscles.  I general -- it genuinely seemed as if you had a tireless passion for your work, for the sport, and, in turn, for us.  You were not yet the famous Olympic doctor.  You were not a doctor at all.  You hadn't started medical school at Michigan State University.  You weren't married to Steph.  I hadn't been a guest at your wedding nor danced at your reception yet.  You were not a father to three children, two of them little girls.  So who were you back then?  You were a young man with his whole future ahead of him, a future that seemed to be full of nothing but promise and passion.  You were the man who was loved and trusted by dozens and dozens of us little girls and our families.  You quickly became a fixture at the gym, everyone's favorite.

When he broke us mentally and physically, depriving us of water on a hot summer's day in the un-air conditioned gym or pushing us to practice on broken bones, you were the one who stepped in.  You defended us.  You stood up to him on our behaves.  You protected our bodies from further pain.  You literally and metaphorically put us back together.  It seemed as if we were a little family back then.  In hindsight, a readily dysfunctional one all in a sense growing up together.  You, John, Kathie Klages, and that first generation of gymnasts known as the originals.  We were all armed with nothing but dreams.  John dreamed of getting a girl to the Olympics at any cost.  You dreamed of becoming a sports medicine doctor.  And I with mediocre gymnastics ability dreamed of going away to college, getting married, having a family.  And I also dreamed of becoming a sports medicine doctor because that was your dream and I wanted to be just like you.  Those early years in the gym were brutal, as I know you must remember.  John was young and pushed all boundaries.  He was boss.  The enforcer.  The screamer.  The thrower.  The perfectionist.  The one from whom we desperately sought approval or even just some small sign that he actually cared for us and not just for winningYou, Larry, were the gentle one, the nurturer who always had a smile, a hug, a kind word.  You earned our trust.  You earned my trust.  But, more importantly, as I was just a little girl, you earned my mother's trust.  You treated us like family.  You attended each of my doctors' appointments.  You sat with my mother during my surgeries.  We were guests at your wedding.  And yet at some point you began pushing boundaries in your own terribly, terribly troubled way.  None of us will ever, ever, ever know when or where you started abusing children.  Was that always your plan when you found yourself attracted to the sport of gymnastics as early as high school?  Had you abused anyone before then?  Was the good guy persona just an act?  Were you building our trust for a reason?  So that you could perpetrate and penetrate later on?  And, most importantly, who was that first girl?  Am I her?  Do you even remember?  Do you even remember what we will never forget?  Can you even remember, Larry, when it all began?  Was there any traceable, albeit faint, voice of conscious within you back then saying, don't do it?  Do you remember how you justified it to yourself that first time?  I am sure I will never know the answers to my questions, but what I do know is that I laid alone naked in your apartment in , me,  years old, you  years old, while you massaged my tiny body, touching my clitoris and penetrating my formerly un-penetrated self.  By this time you were in medical school at the Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine.  You had called my home and asked me to come to your apartment where you once lived -- where you lived alone because you were conducting a study on flexibility on behalf of the medical college and you needed subjects for the study.  My mother was out of town but granted permission for me to go to your house because not only did she love and trust you, but because I was supposed to be one of several subjects participating in your Michigan State study.  I got a ride to your apartment from my neighbor, and, predictably, there were no other subjects there.  You instructed me to disrobe and take a bath in your tub in order to heat my muscles and relax which would aide in your measuring of my flexibility.  After my bath you rewarded me for my generous participation in your study by having me lay naked on the treatment table in the living room of your sparse one bedroom apartment as you massaged the entirety of my  year old body, suggesting that I relax as you slipped your adult fingers in and out and in and out of my body.  That was one of the many, many times that your hands were in me, on me over the next many years.  You became a doctor, started treating more patients, and we all know how the rest of this story unfolds.  Now here we sit, Larry, exactly  years since our paths first crossed.  Next year I will be  years old.  And you, you're spending the rest of your life in prison.  What you have to live with at this point as a purported Catholic man is not my problem and, quite frankly, I really do not care, but what I have to live with?

      " AMmedical school student or Michigan State doctor or Olympic doctor, then I could have spared every girl who came after me and the suffering that only someone who has experienced this will understand.  You chose to take from me, from all of us, something that was simply not yours to take; a shaken, if not irreparable, sense of self, a grave inability to trust, to open ourselves up to love, to sleep, to work, and some days to breathe.  What you took was sick and psychotic and disturbed and bottom line a robbery.  Had I been able to identify the wolf in sheep's clothing of a sexual predator under the guise of a loving friend and medical professional and eventual employee of the trusted Michigan State University, none of the other girls would be standing here before you this week having to face you, their robber.  So what you need to hear from me today is this.  When a grown man penetrates the vagina and/or the anus of a small girl or does anything at all to compromise her sense of trust or safety, the course of her life is changed forever.  In that moment when you had each and every girl who is here this week on your table, not to mention the hundreds and thousands, potentially, of girls who are not here or have not yet come forward, in that split second when you made the choice to put that finger inside of our little tiny bodies for the first time, not for medical treatment but for your own pleasure, you changed the entire course of our lives.  One moment, one finger, you took something from us that we will never, ever get back.  Our innocence.  Our childhoods.  And, in a sense, our virginities.  Those were not yours to take.  And yet in that moment when you took each of us -- from each of us for the first time, the course of your life did not change -- well, not immediately anyway.  You ate dinner.  You brushed your teeth.  And you went to sleep.  You were rewarded with prestigious roles.  You got to travel the world.  You were entrusted with the job of caring for the United State's most talented gymnasts.  You went to the Olympics, not once, many times, before John and then with John.  How each victim survivor has and will continue to navigate this life-altering catalytic experience that you chose for us will run the entire spectrum.  Some will never trust, never engage in functional relationships, sexual or otherwise, and some will never give birth because the very thought of having to see a physician who will have to touch them in personal places paralyzes them.  Some will suffer from anxiety and sleepless nights for the rest of their lives.  Some will never overcome the depression that results from having been a victim of your sexual abuse.  Others will become activists, warriors for this cause.  They will dedicate their lives to ensuring that people like you are not enabled and in a sense indirectly permitted to do as much damage as you were enabled to do by the likes of Michigan State University, USA Gymnastics, and Twistars.  And me, Larry?  I want you to know that while you spend the rest of your life behind bars, my life has been and will be okay.  I am a survivor of stage four disease.  I live with two autoimmune diseases, and I haven't slept soundly since .  I could spend another hour depicting how I personally, medically, and psychologically have suffered at your hands, but, quite frankly, I don't care to.  All you need to know about me, Larry, is that I'm free, I am successful, I am a mother, and I am happy.  Not because you were one of the most, if not the most, formative males in my entire life but in spite of you and in spite of that fact.  I am okay.  What I know for sure, Larry, is this, your legacy will not be that of a healer, of a great Olympic, Michigan State doctor, of a respectable man, of a good father, or husband, or son.  Unfortunately, your legacy is that you are quite possibly the greatest perpetrator of sexual abuse of all time.  That, my former friend and loved one, is yours to live with.  None of us in this room, Larry, is your final judge.  You may attempt to do good while you are in prison, removed from society for the rest of your life, and knowing you, you will and you will try, but what you've done, what you've taken, and how boldly and shamelessly you've taken it for decade after decade after decade, I can only wonder what might become of your soul.  I pray for Steph and your children because the Lord knows they need it now and they will always need it.  And I pray for the hundreds of women you abused who have not come forward, each for their own heavy reasons.  And as for you, Larry, the rest of your life you will be a prisoner, but what should we call you?  A predator?  A criminal?  A molester?  A psychopath?  A pornographer?  An abuser?

They were very heartfelt and powerful, but also I know you say you've gotten past it, and I don't know if you'll ever really get past it, only you know the harm, and one of the things that you said troubles me in that being one of the earliest ones you wonder if you would have said something then, if it wouldn't be this case.  That's a heavy burden for a  year old, and at your age I know there's still a  year old girl inside of you who feels that way.  And I need you to let go of that.  I don't think there's any victim -- actually, I know there is no victim survivor who blames any other victim, including the first or the second or the third.  Because as you know as a lawyer, as a trained individual, so much goes unreported because of the pointing of blame, not belief of the treachery.  When you talk about it, people don't want to believe it.  It's not a popular subject.  There's no one that blames you, and you need to just let go of that, because you've done so well, and I think that's a bit of a stumbling block, and you are absolutely correct, your life is wonderful and it will continue to be so and you are just this -- because you're a little bit older -- no offense, you're beautiful, but you're a little bit older than the rest of the victims, so they can look at you and say, I can be like her, because some of them are not as strong as you yet, so it's so important that you talk about what you did, what you accomplished, that you've let go of this, and the only thing I ask you is to let go of that  year old girl, give her permission to say it's okay, I didn't report it, because you know at  you are powerless really.  You don't have a voice.  There were adults who should have been watching and checking.  It's not your fault there's other victims, so let go of that, and thank you for being such a strong role model with such an epic voice.

      "  When our kids were little Lindsey's dad and I thought we made every effort to keep our kids safe from harm, but what we did not realize was that we missed what the true concern was.  It wasn't the wrong crowd or going places that they weren't supposed to be or even using drugs or alcohol.  It was something we never thought we would have to even think about, it was this man, Larry Nassar.  He was someone we completely trusted.  He was our friend, our neighbor, Lindsey's friend, and her doctor.  Someone who was so well respected by everyone we never second-guessed his intentions on our daughter.  Larry had been Lindsey's doctor since she was nine years old.  He was also Lindsey's mentor, her confidant, her employer, and he was also someone who ultimately abused her on a daily basis for many, many years, starting around the age of .  These photos are how little she was when he began the abuse on her.  He convinced these little girls that this was a medical treatment necessary to help their injuries.  He also told and convinced the little girls not to discuss this treatment with their parents because they would not understand.  This treatment continued for many years.  These children thought that this was the norm.  He was doing it to multiple gymnasts so they all thought this was what Larry did to make them feel better.  These girls had no idea this wasn't a medical procedure.  He had always told -- we always told both our kids that if anyone touches you down in your private areas, except for a doctor, to come to us immediately.  She had no reason to be alarmed because he was her doctor, just as we told her.  He was also someone she completely trusted, her sound board after a long, hard practice.  Why would he ever want to harm her?  Our family was devastated to learn of Larry's actions.  We did not want to believe it, but it hit hard and fast.  The betrayal we feel is sometimes very hard to grasp.  Our daughter is scarred forever.  Our son is scarred forever, and we as parents are scarred forever.  Lindsey's dad, her brother, and I will never be the same.  We trust no one.  We have many sleepless nights over the guilt we feel for missing this.  We never imagined that we would be those parents we all see on the news whose children were abused by someone, someone close to their family, and the parents had no idea.  This is us.  This is our true reality.  The guilt we feel will never go away.  All the questions we think of and all the red flags we missed, it truly has been gut wrenching and will be embedded in our minds forever.  With his lack of true remorse, this is a person who will repeat his crimes.  You can hear it in his statements to you and other judges that he still does not accept the damage he has done to all these kids, parents, his own family, and all that was associated with him.  Your Honor, we ask that you give this monster the longest sentence available so he never harms again.

I had worked so hard to get there and I, along with my family, had sacrificed so much to get to that point.  My spine was badly fractured and my life, but more important to me, my gymnastics career was falling apart.  He was the only one I was wildly assured who could really help me, help me further than any other doctor had helped me so far.  He was just so talented and brilliant, they said.  Indeed, he did seem impressive.  He was absurdly nice and did everything he could to make me feel comfortable the second I met him.  He smiled widely each time he saw me and on the surface it felt like he genuinely cared for me.  It seemed like he was determined to help me get better and that gave me another level of certainty.  Most of all, he gave me hope.  I thought he was the most trustworthy doctor I ever could have imagined.  In my innocence I felt that I would have done anything -- anything to heal my fractured back and not quit the sport I loved and persisted through since I was two years old.  Gymnasts are tough as nails.  They will fight.  They will bleed.  And they will persist all for their dreams.  And that's exactly how I was.  I still remember Nassar calmly and vaguely assuring me that his treatment regiment might be a little uncomfortable but that it would surely help to heal my pain and return me to the sport I loved.  These were just the magic words I was looking for that none of the many other doctors I had previously seen would tell me.  Here I was a scared little girl in excruciating back pain, willing, begging even to suffer through for my sport.  This grown man confidently offered me salvation, healing, and freedom, and I trusted him, but he turned out to be a monster.  I am disgusted -- disgusted that Larry Nassar, the trusted adult, authority figure, and famous doctor had the audacity to use his incredible power, prestige, and influence to sexually abuse me, a little girl, right there in his office in the safest and warmest of places with such an overlying sense of healing and recovery.  I was counting on him.  He broke in loudly without consent or restraint.  He was an unwarranted intruder to my most private, intimate, never before touched places without warning, without gloves, and without explanation.  And so again and again and again he abused me all the while telling me wild tales of his Olympic journey and his family, very confidently, suavely even, trying to distract me from the un-distractable.  It certainly seemed and, unfortunately, viscerally and physically felt like he had done this treatment many times before.  This was yet another reason I desperately told myself to trust him.

      " AMaway depressed, dejected, molested, and confused, now alone to part ways with my deepest love, gymnastics.  My innocence was ruthlessly taken away from me never to return.  This was such a dark period in my life that still today is difficult for me to revisit.  As I stand here I still flashback to the feelings of fear laying frozen in his office, my sweating, shaking body, adrenalin pumping, painfully clutching the sides of the table waiting for this sick treatment to be over.  My little child self, smarter and more astute than I gave her credit for, knew something was wrong but she was petrified to the point of physical and emotional paralysis as she tried so hard to keep trusting this man she thought was her savior, vigilantly ignoring how she felt and what was really going on.  I was so afraid to talk to anyone.  The most confusing part was that my mother was in the room with us while this happened.  He strategically placed himself between us and skillfully obscured what was happening.  I felt a disoriented sense of safety since my mom was there, and, after all, he told me it was going to be uncomfortable.  What I didn't realize, she couldn't see exactly what was happening.  This sickens and continues to baffle me to this day.  Larry made me believe that this was my only hope.  That he was my only hope.  Besides, all the other adults around me told me so, and I so shut my eyes so tight that they hurt and I held my breath.  I summoned that notorious gymnastic strength and I marched forward.  For years I had this atrocious secret and fear.  I felt so much shame and embarrassment.  I suffered but I told myself to be tough.  When the reports about him started trickling out I just knew I was right all this time and I wasn't alone.  Then my world swiftly stopped.  Everything I had pushed away for so long came over me like a waterfall.  All my denial, repression, and depression that had been present and underlying there all along overcame me.  My trauma reopened anew; a fresh deep wound.  While the constant news following Nassar this past year has been vindicating at some points, it has mostly been cruel and exhausting.  I relive my pain each and every day questioning why he did this to us and never finding the right answer.  I completely dropped out of my life this past year as the gravity and wickedness of Nassar's serial abuse has overcome me.  Months at a time I did not leave my bed, sometimes questioning why I was even alive, all while his touch continued to violently linger on my body as it does today.  I lost my wits.  I screamed.  I woke up crying.  I went to bed crying.  I did not, I still do not understand.  These uncomfortable, invasive memories are my reality now.  The imprint of his face and abuse hinder my life which at times has turned into a nightmare.  Crippling complexes such as paranoia, anxiety, depression, sexual issues, and insomnia, to name a few, have all taken their unique and oppressive turn at overshadowing my life as a direct result of what Larry Nassar did to me.  Then and now his abuse has cost me.  It is important to everyone hearing this that to this day I still do not feel safe.  The world feels unsafe.  Men feel unsafe.  I can't sleep without a night light.  I'm paranoid when I walk anywhere alone, looking around every corner constantly believing I'm about to be attacked.  If someone enters a room without announcing themselves I jump and border on the edge of a nervous breakdown.  I'm intensely vigilant that someone, somewhere, whichever place I might be is about to take advantage of, sexualize, or hurt me.  There are oftentimes I shield myself from the world and pray that men don't find me appealing lest they target me, manipulate me, and hurt me like Nassar so smoothly did.  I feel disconnected from the world, alone, and in pain.  I couldn't trust anyone to keep me safe back then and I can't trust anyone to keep me safe today.  I have lost my ability to be confident with myself and others.  To those at MSU, USAG, and the USOC who knew about Larry Nassar and did not act, the sin of omission is just as bad as the sin itself.  As if dealing with the intense publicity and pain around Nassar wasn't enough, you have added a heartless, depraved level of denial and victim shaming to the mix.  You have said terrible things.  For example, that victims didn't understand the nuanced difference between sexual abuse and medical treatment and it is virtually impossible to stop a determined sexual predator on your campus.  This is disgusting.  Do you know how the statements make us feel?  Do you understand the impacts of our words?  Do you know how these statements put other victims in the state of fear so deep that they may never come forward?  // \n",

Your attitudes of apathy and dismissal have made the healing process particularly difficult, especially because you haven't taken actions to produce legitimate investigations.  This means that every day we still have to remind ourselves it's okay that we came forward.  What happened to us is very, very real, even though we so desperately tried to deny it for so long.  I recently learned that Nassar's crimes could have been prevented as early as  when the first brave woman came forward.  Learning our abuse could have been prevented but instead flourished for decades is a bitter and nauseating pill to swallow.  Adults were enamored by Nassar because they experienced all of the trustworthy, impressive, illustrious talented elements of him, minus the abuse.  They wanted to protect him, and now that the act is up, they are emotionless and indifferent, lackadaisically managing the issues they once overlooked and placing their limited information on evading responsibility as opposed to taking ownership.  Shame on you.  I'm only now beginning the long road of healing.  I am so grateful for the incredible women who have come forward and made it possible for me to be brave enough to tell my story.

I still have medical issues that he was supposed to be treating me for but failed.  I do not trust doctors because of how he took advantage of me for his own sick pleasures.  I do not trust people to know that this story belongs to me as he makes me feel dirty, disgusting, and ashamed.  What he did to me has damaged my future as I do not find myself worthy of love.  I see myself as damaged and tainted.  Therefore, it has been hard to let someone else love me as I do not love myself.  I cannot say exactly where I would be today if this had not happened to me.  Knowing the path that I was on before he abused me compared to where I am now is like night and day.  Before I met Larry Nassar I was an honor roll student, socially active, involved in many groups, and volunteered.

I called my mother after talking to an attorney and she expressed how relieved she was that I was doing something about what he did to me.  I was so confused.  After talking with her more about it, she knew what he was doing but thought it was a medical procedure just like everyone else.  She said that it made her uncomfortable and that is why she stopped going to my appointments.  I felt abandoned.  I lost faith and trust in her role as a mother.  Since this has come out it has made me very hypervigilant on whether anyone knows who I am, who can I trust to tell, and how do I tell them something like this?  Also, if I do tell them, what if someone overhears?  Will people look at me differently?  Will people judge me or will they pity me because they feel bad?  Larry Nassar manipulated me psychologically.  He made me deny how I felt when I was screaming inside to stop what was happening because he acted so calm like nothing ever happened.  He made me trust him and not second-guess his medical procedure.  There are things in my past that I am not proud of.  This has made me question what all details to include on how this has changed me for fear of being judged.  I would never have to worry about these details if I never had to live the nightmare of Larry Nassar being my doctor.  Even though I am not a famous gymnast, I still matter, and my story is relevant.  I hurt too.  With all of the media attention on gymnasts and not what he did has taken the focus away and may deter girls like me to come forward and deny that something has happened to them as they are not a gymnast.

After leaving his office at MSU I was completely humiliated and mortified.  I was scared and confused about what had happened to me.  I didn't know how to approach anyone to tell them about what had happened out of embarrassment and fear.  The memory of what Larry Nassar did haunted me on a daily basis.  I eventually quit gymnastics, never seeking another doctor to address my back pain.  Even after my career in gymnastics was over I still thought about what had happened to me.  Since all of this has come to light, the memory of what Larry Nassar did to me has only been intensified.  Not only do I think about what Larry did to me, but to all the other victims as well.  The thought of Larry Nassar remains in my daily thoughts and my dreams.  It is a memory that I will never forget.  Nothing can change what Larry Nassar did to me and the other victims.

      "  Thank you.  Your Honor, I appreciate the opportunity to address the court in order to tell my story and the impact that the abuse I suffered by Mr. Nassar has had on me. I was  when I went to see Mr. Nassar for help with my back pain.  At the time my father was terminally ill with cancer so my parents were unable to attend this appointment.  Mr. Nassar took advantage of my circumstances and of me.  I remember him telling me that he could give me a massage to help with my back pain.  I cautiously undressed and laid down with a sheet over me as he instructed.  He proceeded to penetrate me vaginally and massage my breasts.  My body froze.  I was screaming inside but lay there too scared and confused to do anything.  After he completed his, quote, treatment, he told me to get dressed while he sat there watching.  He then scheduled weekly visits for me.  In a daze I left the office only to be stopped by the receptionist to schedule my next appointment.  I informed her he had already done so to which she looked confused and responded, quote, he doesn't schedule his own appointments.  After reviewing my chart she was hesitant but verified that he had scheduled these.  Looking back I realize that he had scheduled these to continue the abuse.  He had found a young girl in a vulnerable situation and intended to take full advantage of that situation.  When I got home from school that day I told my mom what had happened.  She took me to the police station where I filed a report and went to the hospital to get a sexual assault kit done.  I was terrified of what this exam entailed.  I sat in a cold hospital room, my body tensed when they took the samples.  I remember fearing that no one would believe me.  Unfortunately, this fear became a reality.  About a week later the police contacted my family and asked us to come in for a meeting with Mr. Nassar.  I told my parents that I did not want to face him so they went without me.  At this meeting Mr. Nassar informed my parents that this was simply a misunderstanding and that because I was not a gymnast, I was not as comfortable with my body.   of  sheetsPage  to  of // \n",

      " AMThere was no investigation and I was left to feel like the whole situation was my fault.  I felt powerless and like there was no one I could trust.  I struggled with these feelings as I watched my dad dying right in front of me.  My anxiety was at an all time high.  I suffered so severely that at times I was unable to leave my home.  I began medication and therapy.  To this day I still suffer from anxiety and continue with these treatments  years later.  I went on with my life and successfully pursued my career as a physician assistant.  However, the memory of what happened never left me.  For  years I wondered if I was the only one or if there were others he had done this to.  I tried to convince myself that I was the only one and that I had scared him enough by filing a police report so that he would never do this again.  Sadly, this was not the case.  I remember the day I found out about the other allegations.  I broke down and a huge wave of guilt came over me.  I felt like I should have done more to stand up for myself and to prevent the abuse of the other women.  As the number of victims grew and the stories came out, I was horrified.  Mr. Nassar took away the innocence of so many young women and girls.  He blamed us for, quote, misunderstanding what had happened.  I will never forget what Mr. Nassar did to me but I do have a sense of relief knowing that no other young woman or child will be subjected to his abuse.  I recently gave birth to my first child and therefore was unable to travel to Michigan for sentencing.  This is a joyous time in my life but the trauma from the past and the realization of the extent of his abuse has put a cloud over it.  I will move on and continue to be a loving wife and mother.  I will continue my work as a PA and provide compassionate care to other victims of sexual abuse.  I hope that some day he will realize the affects he has had on his victims and their families.  I am hopeful that today will provide justice and assistance in the healing process for all of Mr. Nassar's victims.  Sincerely, Brianne Randall.  THE COURT\n",

I don't know if Brianne is listening or not but there will be a record, and what I want to say to her is that today with her words there is no misunderstanding of what happened.  I am very clear that no victim has lied, that they were all assaulted, that the use of treatment was misused, mis-defined, and I suspect that there were appointments that were not needed, probably in violation of other statutes, insurance paid for this, so the crimes just get bigger and bigger, and I'm saddened that Meridian Township Police Department, who I know to be very efficient, very good, and we hear testimony all the time from them, I see the good work they do, I'm sorry they missed this one.  But, again, defendant became a good liar, and what happened, what I'm gathering from all these victims, is that because Meridian Township, because universities, because parents, all unsuspecting, seemingly, defended him, he felt untouchable so he continued to touch children for his own pleasure.  I have heard what Ms. Randall has said and I applaud her words, and I can't imagine not being believed while her father is dying, so she's grieving the loss of her childhood and the loss of a parent.

But the last year I've had to put a brave face on in front of my young children to protect them from their sad, confused, and grieving mother.  I have had to forgive my parents for not being more involved in my treatments as an injured and defeated young college athlete.  I have had to explain to my loving husband why intimacy had become difficult for me.  I will be affected by Doctor Nassar's abuse for the rest of my life.  At the time of the treatment I hated his demeanor.  His use of too much medical jargon, his groping and his touching of my vaginal area inside and out.  I dreaded every appointment.  I was suffering from a herniated disc, L- and S-, and had chronic nerve pain shooting down my legs.  I had already had one surgery and was trying to avoid a second more serious spinal fusion surgery because I knew the impact it would have on my collegiate athletic career and my life.  I was  years old.  All I wanted to do was to be able to compete in my sport again and live a pain-free, active lifestyle.  My athletic trainer trusted that Doctor Nassar would live up to his reputation.  Doctor Nassar was recommended to me as the second opinion outside the medical team at the University of Michigan.  His reputation, his authority, his accolades cloud the truth behind the procedures that was supposed to alleviate the nerve pain and to help me avoid surgery.  They didn't.  I had to have that spinal fusion surgery, but not before I endured several sessions of pure torture and agony.  Each treatment was an hour.  He massaged my breasts, buttocks, groin, hips, and would end with what felt like endless digital penetration.  Doctor Nassar never stopped his hands.  His treatments made mefeel like I was an animal, a piece of meat.  I remember using a rough paper towel in his office after treatment to wipe him off of me before leaving the exam room.  I remember being sore inside.  As a student athlete on scholarship at a Division One, Big Ten university with strength coaches, head coaches, assistant coaches, trainers, sports doctors, and physical therapists, the list goes on and on, our bodies were our most prized possession.  We trained them, worked them, and dealt with high levels of pain running through them.  Mind over matter.  Athletics were not something I did, an athlete was who I was.  Keeping my body healthy to maintain my spot on the field and maintain my financial scholarship was the most important thing in my life.  I was  years old but still a child living within the bubble division one Big Ten college sports.  I had to trust my coaches, trainers, and physical therapists.  I had to trust my doctors.  No questions asked.  Doctor Nassar knew this.  Doctor Nassar preyed on my desperation and my weakness.It is my opinion that Doctor Nassar should be held accountable for his strategic and manipulative abuse.  His sentence should keep him in prison for the rest of his life just as I was a victim of his abuse for the rest of mine.  Thank you, victim two. THE COURT\n",
